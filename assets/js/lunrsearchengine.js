    "body": "Project240z. com was originally about a boy and his toy. Originally picked up from a friend in Farmington, Missouri on May 7th, 2006, the car spent almost 4 years with Chris Hammond. He got it running with a turbo motor from a 280z, and then blew that motor up on its first autocross run. Eventually Chris and his wife moved to Colorado, then on to California. The car was sold in Colorado. This website was used to track the progress of the build. The website is kept around for archival purposes, and with hopes that one day Chris will own another Datsun 240z. Chris also has Project350z. com and Project370z/Project400z with hopes that one day both of those websites have a vehicle as well. "

Lesson learned from the day: Don’t get anxious and compete in a car before it is complete. I hadn’t tuned the car properly, and likely ran it to lean (also didn’t record any of the data, yet again, too anxious).  2 years later, we moved the car to Colorado with us, it drove under its own power at that point, but was sold shortly thereafter as we moved again on to the state of California, where we knew we wouldn’t have the resources to keep/maintain the car.

Then, a couple weeks ago I got these in my inbox: &#160;&#160;&#160; I cried a little bit. The car looks great, it has a motor in it, and it even has license plates! I’m glad he sent them to be, but it definitely makes me sad, to see the car up and running, all one color, I had it 4 years and never had it looking that good! Great work, I hope to hear more about the car in the future. I’m still debating what is going on with the 350z, one day I want to trade it and get an EVO or STI, other days I want to keep it and put a turbo on it. We’ll see, for now I imagine it will stick around because we’ve got a lot of other things going on and the budget doesn’t necessarily allow for a turbo AWD right now. "

I was love at first site, but it took a internet chat conversation with 4 guys to get you where I wanted you. Once your previous owner let a price slip I jumped on the opportunity to buy you, and a week later you, and a billion parts, were loaded up into a trailer for the trip home.  I got you home and you fit right in next to your younger sister, it wasn’t long before she left our family to join Dozzle in Kansas City (she’s been recently reincarnated though).  The next 6 months you didn’t get much attention, but you did gain an unsightly brother, a 1978 2+2 that you would learn to love later in life, as he provided a replacement heart for you, along with eye sockets and chest plate to cover the heart.   &lt;p&gt;In June, about a month after you did start off strong in June by losing your inner self. That was the start of something beautiful, you became an internet star, getting thousands upon thousands of views of your videos. You even show up very high in the search results for 240z &lt;/p&gt; It was the spring of 2007 before any real progress was made on you, with the very generous help of many friends you got a new heart. With that new heart you even got to stretch your legs a bit in July and August of that year. Before your legs were fully stretched though I decided it would be a good idea to give those legs a go on an autocross course, no video of that day is available, but there are photos of your glorious and fateful run. Though you didn’t even get to complete the full run, I had to get out and assist you, and recruit other help as well, to get back to your grid position.   &lt;p&gt;You punished me for taking you out for an autocross too early in your recovery, and showed me your displeasure by destroying the number 2 piston, and providing a nice beautiful mix of oil and coolant when I get you home and drained you. &lt;/p&gt; After this incident you sat for a quite a while, really until late 2008, you lived partially in a warehouse, sometimes in the garage in Missouri. Though with a little effort you got a new heart put in, you even got to cruise around the neighborhood one last time before being loaded onto the trailer and taken to our new home in Colorado.   &lt;p&gt;Life in Colorado wasn’t as grand as you had hoped though. You did get some attention here and there, but new priorities in life got in the way of the real attention you needed. It was then decided that you would be better served by finding a new owner. Today that new owner came and took you away. I hope you enjoy your new life, you were my first real project car, and while I never completed you, I am greatful for the time we spent together. I will miss you 240z, perhaps one day in the future I may run into one of your twins. &lt;/p&gt; "

This weekend the car sold, an airman from the local Air Force base in Denver came by and gave me a deposit for the car. I’m going to try to get the title cleaned up this week and hopefully get it to him this weekend if he comes up with the rest of the money. I’ll post again when the car is gone. Thanks for all the interest in the car lately, unfortunately 99% of the interest came after I sold the car, not before, but oh well. For now check out my new toy, http://www. project350z. com/ "

    "title": "1973 Datsun 240z For Sale",
    "body": "2010/01/03 - THIS CAR HAS BEEN SOLD, NO LONGER AVAILABLE So I really am looking to sell the 240z this time around. Though, the more time I spend on it, the less I want to sell it, so perhaps I’ll continue working on it while I wait to see if it sells, and then who knows what will happen after that. At this point in time I’m not looking to part the car out, that might change in the future, but for now I’ll keep from parting it out. Basics:     Price: $1750 with all the spare parts (storage bins full), $1250 with the car as it currently sits. (add $250 to clean up title)    Year:1973    Make: Datsun    Model: 240z    Title: None (can be acquired at additional cost)    Mileage: Unknown    Location: Parker, Colorado (delivery available at $1. 25. mile up to 500 miles from Parker, CO)    Thoughts: Depending on the needs, I can get the title cleared up on this car. I have a California title from a previous owner, I’ve signed it, but never got it titled in my name. It is going to cost me a couple hundred dollars to get the title in my name due to fees, if the purchaser needs a title we can have this done. Engine:    L28E from a 1977 Datsun 280z 2+2    Intake/Exhaust Manifolds from a 1983 280ZX Turbo    Turbo from a 1983 280ZX Turbo    Oil cooler not currently installed, bypassed, parts all there.    Exhaust, straight pipe coming off the turbo, currently dumps under the driver    Thoughts: The motor runs, though it is a tad picky to start. I’m pretty sure it’s a combination of the manifolds and megasquirt needing some adjustment, knowledge I just don’t have. Transmission:    5 Speed from 1977 Datsun 280z 2+2, new urethane bushings on transmission mount.    Thoughts: Transmission works great as far as I know, worked in the parts car that I got it out of, and also drove fine with the previous motor in this car. Fuel System:    Tank: 15 Gallon Fuel Cell    Pump: High Pressure Pump (from Jegs)    Lines: Stainless steel primarily 8AN&#160;  Rail: Custom aluminum rail from Lonewolf Performance    Injectors: Ford Racing 42lb/hr    Pressure Regulator    Thoughts: No known issues with the fuel system, everything works as it should. ECU:    Megasquirt (purchased/assembled from DIYAutoTune)    MS130-C Assembled Megasquirt-I with V3. 0 PCB    MOD_130-EDIS: EDIS mods    MSStim22-C    LG-Wirebund    LC-1 without gauge    Thoughts: As far as I know everything works great with the Megasquirt, the only issues are that I don’t know enough to properly tune everything. Suspension:    Stock 1973 240Z    Spare suspension parts also off a 1973 240z, w/ front/rear sway bars (spares not included for $1250)    I have a urethane bushing kit for the car, but so far have only put bushings into the steering coupler and the transmission cross member. (kit not included at $1250 price)    Thoughts: The suspension is something I intended to address after having the car together, painted, and running. Wheels/Tires:    Stock steel wheels, R-Compound Hoosier Tires    Thoughts: Nothing special here Interior:    Seats: None    Dash: Removed, fiberglass dash available (dash not included at $1250)    Carpet: None    Paint: Interior painted in a black undercoating, except for the dash area which was removed after paint.    Thoughts: The interior needs some love depending on your intentions. I had planned to put a cage in, but haven’t had it done. I had some Corbeau A4 seats in the car, on custom welded in mounts, but the seats were too tall. Putting in other seats may require some fabrication work. My intention was to put in a race seat. Body:    Hood and headlight buckets from a 1977 280Z 2+2    Doors and rear hatch (w/ spoiler) from a different 73 240z    Air Dam, not sure of make, needs paint scraped off and painted.    Thoughts: Passenger floor pan had some rust, cut out and welded in new metal. Floor then covered in fiberglass. The rust doesn’t appear too bad elsewhere, but I’ve not stripped the car looking for things. The body definitely needs some love and a paint job to get the car cleaned up. The passenger door needs some adjustment, it doesn’t close easily but will shut and stay closed. Pictures and Video:    I posted a lot of pictures of the car that I took yesterday, you can see them on this Flickr Set. If you would like to see other photos of specific parts please let me know.    I also took a video of the car running yesterday, you can see it starts off rough, but once going doesn’t sound half bad. Video of the 240z Running Final Thoughts:    I am torn on selling the car, as you can see in the intro to this post. I’ve had it for three and a half years now, and I would love to have the time to finish it, but to be honest I haven’t had time over the past 3. 5 years, I don’t foresee having the time/motivation to do it anytime soon. I’m not going to part the car out, and if it doesn’t sell, perhaps i will find the time to do more on the car. I spent a few hours cleaning things up yesterday and renewed my motivation to want to work on the car, but still not enough to decide not to sell it. If you are interested looking at the car please use the contact form here on Project240z. com, the car is only available on the weekends to be looked at right now. &#160; The two domain names, www. project240z. com and www. 240z. net are not included in this sale, but may be available if someone is interested in those.

True, but I will, at least that’s the plan, to get another one in early 2010 so I can have a car to race next year. I’ve spent a few hours over the past few sick evenings sorting through photos of the old car, which just makes me miss not having a 350Z that much more. I posted photos and got a site design together, though I don’t have much other content up there yet, it will take a few months to get it all together, hopefully just in time to get myself a new (used) ride.

    "body": "2009/10/24 - So I will start this post off staying this: I know nothing, I am a noob when it comes to the megasquirt, and tuning a fuel injection car (or a carb’d car for that matter).  That being said, I think my megasquirt is giving the car too much fuel when it’s trying to start. I don’t know how to prove this, other than to learn how to mess with the fuel map for the megasquirt and see if I can’t back off the fuel a big when trying to start the car. The car doesn’t like to start, it’s very hesitant to do so, and&#160; to me it just sounds like it’s flooded and can’t ignite because of this. I’ll have to do some reading here over the next week or so to see if I can’t figure it out and get the car to reliably start. I did start to adjust the fuel map a bit this afternoon but ended up not getting enough juice from the battery to power the starter and the fuel pump at the same time, so I’ve got the battery on the charge. The charger has been getting a workout today as it was plugged into an 89 RX-7 for a few hours while I charged the battery on that ride up so it can be loaded on the transport truck later today (if the guy ever shows up). Earlier this week I did manage to get the datsun started, and even backed it out of the garage, but I couldn’t keep it running enough to drive it back in so I had to push it. I moved it over into the third bay so that I could make room for the F250 to park inside for the winter. That truck is huge, barely fits into our 24ft garage (we also have 18” shelves in front of it), but it does fit, so that made the wife exceptionally happy! I’ll try to get some new photos of the Datsun later this week. I may start doing some body work prep on it, I have a coupon for a maaco paint job for $275, so I think I’ll get some bondo out to smooth out some rough spots and get it ready for paint. Bondo? Maaco? I don’t see any value in putting a lot of money into the exterior of this Datsun at this point. I just need it to run, and not be 5 different colors, so I’ll take it to Maaco for a flat black paint job and be done with it! "

That would have made a cool video, apologies for not being proactive enough to setup the camera. Anyways, I'm back working on the car, making progress, and hoping to make more progress this weekend getting it running. Yesterday I spent a few hours farting around with the electronics. After ripping out the dash I've been unable to get the car started, rather than continuing to try to make the stock ignition work I decided to just give up on that, and scrap the stock fuse block. I picked up a few fuse blocks from Napa a week or so ago, and yesterday started working on doing the wiring to use those blocks. The video isn't all that entertaining, but I did come up with a cool angle towards the end of the video. I ended up not having the equipment I needed. I ordered more stuff last night and should have it tomorrow, so I can get working on the car this weekend. Now, check out the video! "

I’m a computer geek, but not always the best when it comes to working on the car, I question everything I do, maybe because I blew up the last motor? Part of the wiring problem I’ve had is that I needed to get a fuse block to start hooking things up to, the original block had melted long ago, and only half worked. Last night I went to PepBoys and CarToys looking to see if I could find anything, with no luck. Today I decided to try Napa, SCORE! I actually got two different blocks. One 6 pole and one 10 pole, that way I can break things up if necessary. I hope to get the wiring started this weekend, I would like to attempt to have the car running again, which I think really just means I need to get a switch wired for the starter. I’m not going to deal with a key for the car, this car long run isn’t going to be something someone will be able to walk up and start anyways.

Tonight while trying to get things moved around in the garage to make room for our two primary vehicles I was up on the loft moving things and came across the dashboard! So all is well again in Project240z. com land, well, as well as it can be! I was going to drive the car around the block tonight, and park it in the third car garage, but I quickly realized that wasn’t going to happen unless I wanted to take the wiring harness out of the old dash and hook up the wires. Right now the ignition wires aren’t going to anything, so that would make it kind of hard to start the car and drive it. Oh well, I moved it around a bit by hand and made room for one of our cars in the garage at least, the F350 will have to stay outside for a while longer.

    "body": "2009/08/18 - So tonight after work I got the 240Z off the trailer, both of which had been parked in the Garage since we moved to Colorado a few weeks ago. I had lined up a storage lot for the trailer and wanted to get it out of the garage. Well the 240Z wasn’t easy to start, took a good 5+ minutes of attempts before it finally started up. Later in the day I realized the MAP hose wasn’t hooked up to the Megasquirt, that would explain the difficulty in starting! whoops. So I dropped the trailer off and came home to organize the garage a bit, moved the newly assembled shelves in place and started going through some of my boxes. After I got bored with the unpacking I decided it was a good time to put all the bulbs and fuses that I had purchased yesterday into the car. That was pretty quick and painless, but didn’t produce any fruit! I didn’t see any lights in the rear of the car at all. So what next? I simply decided to pull the dashboard out! The whole thing, gone, removed, not going back in (likely not) along with the blower and heater core. Why might you ask? Why not. The car will hopefully be somewhat streetable, but I won’t be using most of the gauges on the car anyways. For a speedo I’ll have the G2X (GPS data logging), for RPM I’ll likely have the G2X, or even a Netbook running the Megasquirt software to show me all the appropriate date from the ECU. So why do I need the stock dash? I don’t! Though I did realize after I pulled the dash that I left the fiberlass dashboard in St. Louis, and didn’t bring it to CO. Luckily I’m going back to STL next week for work and will hopefully get it packed up and shipped back. I’ll need to do some creative wiring, hooking up a switch for the headlights, a horn, turn signals, and even the ignition, but I think it will be cool to have all those as switchable items on a nice clean looking dashboard, not the big old clunky stock one.

The car is still hard to start, but once it starts up the first time it generally starts up easier (as you will see in the video). I then had trouble trying to get into gear, keep the car running, and letting off the brake as the ebrake isn’t strong enough to keep it at the top of our driveway. I finally just let the car roll down the driveway and started it at the bottom before driving it around. If you want to see it running and driving skip ahead in the video to around 6 minutes.

I did manage to get grease all over the driveway though, which then go on the dogs when Natalie decided to try to wash the dogs in the driveway while I was out there. Whoops! Lesson learned, grease gets everywhere. I’ll hopefully have some time this weekend to get down to Egypt (my boss, with the sandblaster, lives way down in the sticks of MO) to work on sandblasting some of the parts so they can be painted and then reassembled. I’ll take pictures if any of that happens! "

    "body": "2009/06/10 - With the success last night I decided I had to work on the car this evening a bit. The first thing I did was get it up on all four jack stands so that they were under the frame and not under control arms of the car. This would allow me to begin working on the suspension pieces.  When I got the car from Jeff, uhhh over three years ago now, it came with a second suspension that had been pulled off another car. This other suspension has springs (yellow), new(er) struts, a larger front sway bar, and also the addition of a rear sway bar. It also is a lot cleaner then the current suspension. So tonight I started pulling off the front suspension, starting with the sway bar, and moving on to removing the rest, at least what I could, of the right front. I got stuck at the tie rod, but I did manage to get most of the other bolts removed. I came to a conclusion though, I’m going to likely just drop the whole front suspension out, including the cross member as the second suspension has one as well. In order to do that though I am going to have to dismount the motor. I will attempt to do that by lifting the motor up off the mounts with the cherry picker, hopefully without having to disconnect the transmission and not removing the whole thing from the car. Before I do that though I will likely fully disassemble the other suspension and take it to a friend’s house to sandblast everything. I’m heading to Tampa for a conference tomorrow, so that will have to wait until the evenings next week. I’ll try to get everything disassembled during the week, both front and rear suspensions, and then probably go down to his place Saturday if he’ll be around. "

Though I did have to run off to the Autozone Hub to get the replacement starter. The guy at the hub was kind of lost, but he eventually got everything worked out and I headed home with the new (remanufactured) starter. So the last starter started off working, but after a few days just started spinning without engaging the flywheel, no grinding either. This one, once all wired up worked like a champ. I even got the car started up for a minute or so. I did all this without hooking up the computer, so I didn’t want to spend too much time keeping it running. So now was the time, time to hookup the laptop and get the video camera out and record the car actually running! Well I am proud to say it was successful, here’s the video below.

    "body": "2009/05/29 - So last night after work I came home with the intention of trying to figure out why the car wouldn’t start. My intentions were to check the positioning of the 36-1 wheel for the VR sensor that drives the Megasquirt/EDIS setup. After checking the positioning of the sensor I was going to do a compression check on the motor. Well I threw those intentions out of the window, I wanted to see if after charging the battery the night before things would be better as the changes from the night before were not completely tested due to the drained battery. Well wouldn’t you know, the car started! And not just once, but twice! It actually even ran for a bit, assuming I had my foot on the pedal, otherwise it would die, but that didn’t concern me, not yet. So it ran, and I have megasquirt log files to prove it! I went to try to start it again, and got nothing, but this time it wasn’t timing, it wasn’t motor, it was the starter. The starter wouldn’t turn over, it would only click, which made things really weird because I hadn’t had that problem before. Rather than trying to make it work I simply decided to pull the starter out of the car and check it out, it looked okay.  I decided I would take a picture of the flywheel, and as soon as I took a picture I noticed something shining off the flash.  As soon as I took a second look at it I knew exactly what it was. Here’s a photo of it after I pulled it from the flywheel.  Want to know what that is? That is one of the three missing screws from the starter when it fell apart a few weeks ago So with that revelation I decided that I would call it a night from trying to make the car run. I worked on cleaning up some things in the garage, I need to get it up on jack stands and find the remaining 2 screws which I believe are also still in the bell housing. Perhaps this weekend, or early next week I’ll get it up and find them. I also started disassembling the old block, crank and pistons as I need to get rid of those here soon, especially if we find out about our home offer soon (http://www. going2colorado. com) Here’s a brief video of today’s work, nothing too fascinating, next time I have it running I’ll get audio!

Terec came over and helped me out for a bit as well. The first thing I checked was to see what the starter looked like, I was worried based on the noises that I’ve been hearing that the newly installed starter was bad. Well I pulled it out, it looked fine, as did the flywheel itself, so there went that theory. I put the started back on the car and connected the wires. From there I attempted to start the car again. The grinding happened a bit, but I swear it doesn’t last, and even got less frequent as the night wore on. Terec showed up as i was attempting to start the car. We spent most of the evening trying multiple things, rewiring the VR sensor for the megasquirt was the main thing. I attempted it multiple ways, running some new wires for the sensor, and trying different combinations of connections on the wires. At the end of the night we really didn’t seem to get anywhere. Throwing the timing light on the car it does appear to be close to the correct timing, though I need to find TDC again tomorrow night and check to make sure that the VR sensor is 60 degrees from the missing tooth on the wheel. The last attempt at starting the car seemed to only get 100rpm from the starter, so we assume that the battery was drained a bit too much. Because of that we threw it on the charger and called it a night. Another thing that just struck me, I need to check the compression on the motor tomorrow, that hasn’t been done :( "

Nothing, no signal, looks like the EDIS doesn't see it at all anymore. Remove VR sensor plug, replace with a different plug, from the box of EDIS&#160;supplies. Crank, what, what you want me to start? Okay, vroom vroom Run around like a chicken with my head cut off, call Whittle and tell him the news. Put a fan on top of the car to blow out all the smoke from the garage Crank crank, damnit, won't start, flooded. Remove the plugs, dry them off, crank it without plugs to try to get rid of fuel, whoops forgot to turn off the injectors Turnoff injectors, crank it again, blow out the cylinders with air from the compressor Insert plugs, wires Crank crank vroom vroom vroom, turbo whistle It was a successful day! So tomorrow I'll get the radiator back on the car, and put the exhaust system on the car, and we'll see what she does then.

    "body": "2009/05/04 - So I spoke with my Megasquirt Guru last week a few times, and again this weekend, and even had him show up in my driveway to help wrench on the car today! So yesterday I got up and checked to see if the 36-1 wheel for the Megasquirt (using Ford EDIS) was correctly mounted, meaning, should the mounting have changed due to moving from the 1983 motor, to the 1978 motor. I removed the radiator in order to get to the front of the motor, draining it out was probably a good idea. We had put water in last weekend when getting things ready to start, well the water was pretty darn rusty and dirty when I took it out yesterday, probably need to do that a few more times just to make sure everything gets flushed from the radiator (sitting for 2 years) and the block, which has been sitting for 6 or more years (2+ since it last ran, longer since it actually was used much).  After getting the radiator out of the way I was able to confirm that TDC on the 78 motor is the same as the 83 motor, which makes things easier, I don’t have to have the pulley and 36-1 wheel modified, but it didn’t get me any closer to figuring out why I can’t get the car started. I ended up bring in the Megasquirt inside so I could hook it up to my Stim and the laptop to figure out if I could see why I was getting a weird RPM signal from it when the computer was hooked up. I wasn’t able to do much there either, but Andy Whittle told me to bring the squirt and the Laptop over to his house on Sunday and he would help me out. Natalie and I went to the gun range, and afterward I had a voicemail from Andy, he was on the way up to my house, talk about service! Andy and I spent a few hours in the garage working on things.  We ended up figuring out that the squirt/stim worked fine on his laptop, which meant that it was a software or hardware issue on my laptop, not the megasquirt. From there he adjusted the fuel map quite a bit, we seemed to be flooding the motor so we dropped a lot of fuel, took all the plugs out and cranked it, trying to get fuel out if it was truly flooded, not much came out. All in all we weren’t too successful, but we did get it to almost fire up a few times. A few times we got some nice big backfires, once enough that pressure came up through one of the cutouts in the driver’s side floorboard, enough to make my foot jump off the floor. I ended up removing the VR sensor from the 36-1 wheel at Andy’s suggestion and installed a new one, though the plug is backwards on it, so later this week I’ll try it out again, as well as try rewiring the sensor. These sensors are very picky, so we’re not sure if that’s the problem, or something else, but hopefully rewiring it will correct it and the car will start up! Hopefully right? :D Huge thanks to Whittle for the help today. "

I didn’t get a lot done, but the things I did will save the time I would have had to spend on Saturday doing them. I’ve mostly got the fan in place now, with 4 more bolts to put it onto the clutch. I put the single belt in place, and also hooked up the EDIS trigger on the 36-1 wheel for the megasquirt setup. I also put the throttlebody and the intake to the turbo back on the car. I put the battery onto the charger so that it’ll be ready to go Saturday. The more I mess with that thing the more I realize I need to get that moved to the back of the car soon after the car runs again, rather than having it sitting up in the engine bay taking up valuable room.

First things first I wanted to try and get some of the new bushings I purchased off Ebay back in December into the car, so I attempted to get the old bushings out of the rear motor mount, not having much luck I went to Carquest. They also didn’t have any luck but sent me on to Terry’s Machine Shop in Bridgeton. 25 minutes or so later (which was 20 minutes after they closed) the old bushings were free and room for the new urethane bushings available. I then ran back to Carquest and picked up some lithium grease and headed home. I painted the rear motor mount one last time, as playing around with the bushings had removed some paint, and then I started on other items. I changed the bushing in the steering coupler to use the new urethane bushing, I also spent some time cleaning up some of the dust, and crap in the engine back from 2yrs ago when the car last ran. After doing this I drained the transmission and checked to see if I had any fluid to put back in it before installing it in the car tomorrow, I didn’t so I picked some up tonight. I assembled the new bushings in the rear mount and then test fitted it under the car to make sure it would work, success, so hopefully it goes in smoothly tomorrow. So I didn’t get a whole lot of progress made today, but I hope to tomorrow as Terec will be coming over in the morning and helping me with the big task, getting the motor up and into the car, 6 bolts should be all it takes! Then it’ll probably take me all week to hook up all the wires and lines to it, hopefully I’ll be able to try and crank it over next week. Here’s the video from today, not much "

I ended up sleeping until almost noon this morning, it was nice to catch up on some much lost rest from the travelling the past few months. So after my restful morning I had a few errands to run to get my costume ready for a party tonight. Once those were completed I was able to spend some time in the garage. First things first getting the months of piled on crap off the top of the car. That led me to assembling the 2nd craftsman stool that I had purchased probably 10 months ago now, it was in a box on the hood of the car. Once I could see the top of the car I made room at the back and rolled her back a bit in the garage, this allowed me to get to the motor which has been on the stand for quite some time sitting in front of the car. Without the Corvette in the garage (*sheds a small tear*) I had plenty of room to move the motor over to the free side of the garage to work on. The next step for the car is to get all of the motor bits back together, the manifolds, turbo and all other accessories need to be put on the car so that I can put it back in the engine bay. I spent some time this afternoon cleaning off some more of the grease/dirt that covers the motor. I think Lynn, the previous owner, took it to a rally cross based on all the dirt and grime I’ve pulled off this motor over time. I didn’t get too far today, but I hope that tomorrow I can get all of the parts back on the motor, if I can successfully do that I should be able to get the motor back in the car next weekend. The biggest problem I have working on the car is staying focused, if I’m by myself I tend to stray from the task at hand, and I never seem to get anything done. Case in point today, at some point while working on clearing off the car I got out the angle grinder and wire wheeled the hole where the FM antenna was at one point, I thought it looked like it might be rusting so I took the paint off then sprayed some primer on the car. Now it looks worse than before, but I had fun! :) More updates tomorrow, hopefully with some video. I tried using the Chase Cam today to shoot some video but apparently the PDR doesn’t really care for normal AA batteries as it only stayed powered on for about 5 minutes before shutting off, without me knowing.

Today I started on what I had hoped to do last Sunday, cleaning up and reassembling motor bits. Here's a list of the things I did today, or attempted to do :) Painted the oil pan. Last week dad and I took the Oil pan from the L28ET motor to the car washed and tried to clean it up, it had a lot of left over motor parts in it from the destruction, and I also noticed that the pan itself had taken a beating during  the desctruction, though it only put a few dents in the bottom, no punctures. I cleaned up some of the inside of the pan today and then painted the bottom with some 1200 degree flat black. After painting it I cleaned up and installed a new gasket and  attached the pan to the block. I did figure out that I had to change the oil pickup from the L28ET to the L28E, so that the turbo pan would attach properly. Not a big deal but I hadn't expected that so I spent some time cleaning up the pickup.          Painted exhaust manifold and turbo downpipe. I don't figure the paint will last very long on these as I imagine the turbo will get pretty hot, but I figured I'd at least pretty them up a bit before putting them back on the car.                  Painted the valve cover. The turbo valve cover had a few places where the paint was chipped off, so I hit it with the flat black. I'm not sure it's pretty, but it is better than it was before. It really needs to be powder coated sometime.                  Beyond the above, I also took a few pictures of the bottom of the motor. I'm not exactly sure why, but the coloring of the internals of this motor is far more orange or red than the other motor was. I'm assuming one of the following scenarios. 1. The  motor has a lot more miles on it and the coloring is due to this use. 2. The motor is 5 years older than the other motor and the metal is just different between the two. Anyone have any thoughts? Here's what I'm talking about Photos from Today: &#160;             Photos of the old motor, taken over a year ago. :                 It looks like I won't get much done over the next three weeks on the car. The next three weekends I have out of town races (in the Corvette) and quite&#160;a bit of home work for school, not to mention a lot  going on at the office. "

We pulled the valve cover off, as well as the oil pan, to look things over on the motor. So far things look good, though we could see quite a bit of crap sitting above the valves, mostly dead bugs and such. I tried to get them out with a combination of the air compressor and a shop vac, tomorrow I'll know if it worked. We also removed the oil pan and made sure things down there were alright. We'll check the torque on bolts tomorrow and then put the oil pan from the Turbo motor back on. One thing I noticed, the 78 L28E has round exhaust ports while the 83 L28ET that died had square, so I'll have to do some research and see if the intake/exhaust manifolds should work on that 78 head or not. &#160;My plan was to take the turbo/exhaust setup from the 83 and put it onto the 78, hopefully tomorrow. Other than that, we tried replacing the rear main seal, though I think the one we put in will probably leak more than the one we took out so I've ordered another one. We did all this with the motor on the engine stand which limited our access to the seal, when I have the motor back up on the cherry picker we'll replace the seal before attaching the flywheel and transmission.

After breaking a bolt off in the head trying to get one of the mounts setup for the cherry picker we managed to get the motor up and off the ground, though it took a couple of tries because we tried to get by with  the wrong  parts, meaning bolts in the chain that were too small for what we were doing. Lesson learned, again, use the right damn tools, instead of trying to make the wrong tools work. You'll save time rather than trying to take short cuts. Once we had the motor up on the stand he headed home to work on this car and I started trying to get the motor cleaned up a bit. Here are two before shots, of the front of the motor just caked in dirt and crap. &#160; After spraying it down with degreaser and scrubbing with a wire brush I decided to finish what I started yesterday and remove the manfolds from the side of the motor. That actually went fairly easily, I'm not sure why, perhaps loading up the bolts with WD-40 yesterday before I finished helped, some of them almost seemed loose before I even cranked on them, perhaps Eric or I started to remove them last year when working on the other motor? After getting the manifolds off I took off the last remaining attached item to the side of the motor, but honestly, I'm not sure what it was? At first I assumed it was a power steering pump, but the more I think about it the more I think it might have been the AC compressor? After that I tried to spend some time organizing the garage a bit. I managed to get a few things hung up on the wall and made more room in there for the Corvette. I've still yet to make enough room to bring the 240Z home from storage. I don't think I'll be able to park both cars in the garage until I have the motor in the 240, otherwise I'll never have room in there for both cars and the motor, plus transmissions. Speaking of transmissions, I need to sell the 2 extra ones I have, if anyone is looking for an automatic transmission out of a 73 240Z, or a 5 speed out of a 280Z let me know. I was told the 5 speed needs rebuilding, I have no clue about it other than that. My goal/plan right now is to tear down the L28E and check things over, replace the rear main seal, make sure to clean it out, then try and put it all back together. I don't imagine I'll get that done before May, but I would like to spend time on it over the next few weeks if I can. "

    "body": "2008/03/09 - Today Nick and I ran around town, getting some metal for his 240Z, then around to find a few other supplies that he needed. When I got home I was half motivated to work on the car! So I went out to the garage, after sitting on the couch for 30 minutes, and got to working. It's still cold here in St. Louis so I had the garage door closed and decided to plug the space heater in to warm it up a little bit. I put together&#160;a little rolling stool that I purchased from Sears a few weeks back (please don't visit www. slickdeals. net, that site will make you spend more money at Sears than you ever have before). After putting the stool together I decided I should get to work on the motor. What motor? This motor is out of a 78 280Z 2+2. The parts car, it ran when I got it, so the plan right now is to transfer the turbo/intake/fuel system from the blown 83 motor to this motor. So I started on the motor, working on taking the fuel rail off the motor, along with the injectors and such (all this will be for sale later this week). &#160;I had most everything removed so that I could pull the fuel rail and injectors when I found one hose that was still hooked up to the intake manifold. Being that the motor is 30 years old some of the hoses and clamps are a little hard to remove, easy enough fix, I got a pair of dykes and started cutting. Out pours some gasoline, which I found odd that there was still any fuel in the system. A few moments later when more fuel poured out I realized that the space heater was sitting less than 2 feet from where the fuel was hitting the floor. Talk about getting your heart rate going, I jumped, grabbed the space heater and lifted it off the ground, quickly unplugging it and removing it from the area. Thankfully nothing caught fire! That would of sucked! More work tomorrow, I'm going to try and get the motor up on an engine stand so I can replace the rear main seal which leaks, and try to check everything over before I put it all back together. I could  possibly  have this motor running by the end of the month in the car. But I know how lazy and busy I am, so I have no doubts that there is no way I'll get all that done :) More info and pictures tomorrow, possibly even a new 240Z video! "

Buy an LS1 and drop it in and continue to run in XP   Buy a 5. 3 Vortec out of a Tahoe and continue to run in XP   Drop in the 78 280Z motor in the garage and run FP   Sell the car and buy one of the following to run        C5 Z06 to run in SS     06+ Mustang GT to run in FS       Well, I think option 4. 1 is leading the pack right now. Though my goal is to have the 240Z running by the end of October. My plan is to pull the bad motor out of the car tomorrow, and start replacing the leaky seal in the motor out of the 78 parts car. Get the 78 motor together, fuel injection setup off the Turbo motor, possibly the turbo, intake and exhaust over as well. Install the 78 in the car, get the car running, paint the car, sell the car.

Last night I found another nut for the column and believed that I got it threaded onto the column with a lot of brute force.

I was going to take the valve cover off and see if I saw anything out of the ordinary, then pull the head if I could get to that. Before doing those two things though I figured I should drain the oil out of the motor. Much to my suprise when I drained the oil it wasn't oil that came out first, it was coolant, then oil followed. &nbsp; Once I discovered that I began to lose hope that I would be able to salvage anything in this motor. Thoughts of a cracked block filled my head. Nevertheless I proceeded forward with removing the valve cover and whatever else I could get to. When I pulled the cover off I started looking around and immediately found something that looked out of place. Ends up I found two things out of place, two of the rocket arm guides were laying on the cylinder, with a little Matlock work I found that both the guides from the #2 cylinder were not in the correct place. &nbsp; &nbsp; From there I didn't get too far, I did get the timing sprocket and chain removed, and ended up getting the camshaft remove as well, but I was unable to see anything out of the ordinary. I even tried sticking a magnet into the spark plug hole on the #2 cylinder with hopes of pulling some bits of metal out of there, hoping to find something awry. No dice,&nbsp;so I'll have to wait until this weekend to get further on the investigation. I'm going to have to pull the motor out of the car in order to take the manifolds off so that I can remove the cylinder head and see what happened on Sunday.

I basically didn't touch the car until Thursday, and all I did then was take a few minutes to inaccurately measure the requirements for the flange on the downpipe. Friday I picked up a header collector flange from my buddy Russ' place. Sunday morning I went to work on that flange, it needed some help to make it fit. Sunday afternoon I spent some time in the sauna, I mean garage. I managed to get the coil pack and EDIS module mounted to the fender. I then started trying to clean up some of the wiring in the engine bay. I got some plastic loom a while back so I started running that to cover up the mess of wiring in the engine bay. I also ran the loom in the passenger compartment around some of the wiring in there. It's not finished, but it's definitely starting to look better. Dad helped me to put a switch inline for the main relay. Luckily with the car not idling yet I haven't had problems turning the car off, but with the way things were wired if the car was idling properly you'd have to pull a fuse or disconnect the battery to shut off the car. Now that I have a switch it's easy to do! After that Dad and I put the hood and hinges on the car, the first time since I've owned the 240 that it has had a hood attached! From there we loaded the car up onto the trailer later in the evening. This morning I got up early (a rarity for me) and took the car/trailer over to the Carx on St. Charles Rock Road in Bridgeton. Rick was extremely helpful over there and by 12pm today I was back up there loading the car up on the trailer with Eric's help. Carx put a 3&quot; pipe from the downpipe back to the rear axle, with a turndown on the end. It's still quite loud, but if I do say so myself, it sounds pretty damn sweet! Eric and I brought the car home, and before trying to push it off the trailer I finally got it started. I'm having starter issues and will probably try to replace the starter Thursday or Friday of this week. I drove the car off the trailer and into the garage, it's a beautiful sound! I'm still aiming to compete drive&nbsp;the car at the Autocross on Sunday. Before I can do that I have quite a bit left to do. 1. Fix the idle (longer idle screw) 2. See if there's any fluid in the transmission (can't get the fill plug out so I've not pulled the drain plug yet) 3. Build a bulkhead/firewall for the fuel cell 4. Finish up wiring for the O2 sensor 5. Get a harness squared away 6. More stuff I'm sure I've forgotten! "

    "body": "2007/07/28 - This morning I woke up with a little hope in my eye, hope that I would make some good progress today. After doing some reading online about the Megasquirt and Edis I headed out to the garage. The first thing I noticed was that the coil pack wasn't plugged into the Edis module. I'm not sure if I had unplugged it last night when trying to figure out why we didn't have any spark, or if I hadn't plugged it in at all last night. I then hooked up the laptop and tried to start the car, to see if anything changed. At first nothing was different than last night, no spark and no RPM signal on the squirt. But a few tries later I noticed the RPM on the laptop jumped up. Sporadically I was able to get RPM but nothing consistant or worth a darn from a starting perspective. I decided from there I would need to mount the coil pack and the edis module as I hadn't mounted them yet, they were just laying in the car. To do that I needed to pick up some metal as I didn't have enough to fabricate much. I headed out around noon to the DMV, it was time to get the trailer registered, and then head to Illinois to pickup the trailer, fix the wiring on the trailer, and then hit Home Depot on the way home to pick up the metal. The trailer pickup took far longer than I expected, but with the help of Andy and Chris Hohl I was able to get the wiring on the trailer fixed! When I got home I backed the trailer into the driveway and got to work on the car again. Before I went ahead and started building brackets for the EDIS setup I decided to try and rewire the VR sensor on the car, to see if that might fix my problems. I checked a few things I had lying around. I had a VR sensor for a V6 Ford Explorer, but I was using the VR sensor that matched the 36-1 wheel off a 4Cylinder Escort that I had mounted to the car. I checked the wiring on both sensors and noticed that the colors were opposite on the Explorer plug. After swapping out the VR sensor wires I went to fire the car up, sure enough I had a full RPM signal on the laptop! Score! I then started checking to see if I had any spark. Eric showed up and we weren't getting any spark. To try something out we plugged in the other coil pack and hooked up one wire/plug sitting on top of the valve cover. Once we did this we immediately noticed spark! Score again! Just to see if we had something else wrong we plugged back into the original coil pack, and sure enough this one also sparked. One thing we did to the original coil pack was to run a wire from one of the mounting points to the shock tower on the passenger side. I'm not exactly sure what changed to cause us to start getting a spark, but I think it most likely related to this ground, perhaps, I'll test it out again tomorrow without the ground and see what happens. Once we had spark we hooked the fuel pump back up and tried to get her to fire. First thing we started getting was a few pops and then lots of smoke! Score again! After a few attempted we decided we'd tried enough for the time being. Eric headed out and I decided I needed to try something else. I remembered reading today that the EDIS coil pack should run 132, and we had plugged in the wires for 123, so I swapped this around. As soon as I attempted to start it was a totally different sound, it was beautiful! I've not yet gotten it to start, but it sure sounds like it's trying to. I had Andy Whittle on the phone throughout the night and I sent him a few log files from the data I recorded while trying to start the motor. Around 10pm I figured it was probably a little too late to try to keep starting the car with all the noise it was creating. I got under the car and hooked up the speedometer cable, put the missing bushings into the transmission crossmember and tightened that up as well as the clutch slave cylinder. I've got a few things to try in the morning before I head off to the muffler shop to see if I can't get an exhaust put on the car. Here's some video from tonight, trying to start the car. "

    "body": "2007/07/27 - First off, let me say that today was a good day! It didn't start off that way however. After last night's fuel rail issues I needed to get the rail tapped and get myself a new fitting. At lunch I headed over to SoloPerformance World Headquarters to have Dave assist with tapping the rail. He didn't have a 3/8 NPT tap so I had to head over to Grainger down the street from the SPS offices and pick up a tap. $33 later I was in business and heading back to Dave's. He assisted with tapping the rail again and then I headed south. I needed to go to SCPRacingparts. com to pickup another fitting, they had just what I needed and then I was headed back to the office. When I got home this evening the first thing I did was check to see if the new fitting would be what I needed. I put the fitting into the rail with some teflon and hooked everything up. I pressurized the fuel system, and sure enough, it was leaking fuel again! Not a happy camper was I. With a leaking fuel rail I couldn't do much else so I called up Speed Sports to see if they could help me out by tapping the rail and selling me a new fitting. They were running a little late and not open yet so I decided to work on the power issue we were having with the Megasquirt. On Tuesday we had problems because the MS signal to the laptop was highly unsteady. We weren't sure if it was a power problem, or if it was related to a bad ground. Tonight I replaced the wire we were running to the main relay with a direct line from the battery.  Once I did this the relay kicks in immediately when plugged to the battery, powering up the megasquirt without the ignition being on. This corrected the fluctuation issue, which was great news! Now that the gauges and sensors seem to work fuel was the last major hurdle before I could attempt to start the car. I headed up to Speed Sports and had Lou tap the rail and install a new fitting for me. He showed me that I wasn't using enough teflon on the fitting, and he also managed to run the fitting nearly all the way in, where we were only able to get it in a few threads before. Once I had the new fitting installed I was starting to get excited, perhaps it would hold and I'd be able to see what happens when I cranked the car.  Installation of the rail was easy, I've installed and removed it so much in the past two nights that it is easy to do now. Eric showed up and we pressurized the fuel system a few times. All tests appeared good, no fuel leaking out anywhere! Now it was time, the power was good, the fuel was good, it was time to try and start the car. Eric and I tied up a few last minute things, hooked up the battery, computer to the Megasquirt and watched all the gauges on the PC light up. Eric stood by the front of the car with a fire extinguisher and I reached into the driver's door to turn the key. I turned the key, she cranked over, a beautiful sound I must say. After a few cranks I realized the fuel pump wasn't running, which meant that the squirt wasn't getting an RPM signal as it should be. I looked over at the display and sure enough, no RPMs registering on the PC. Without RPMs the Megasquirt won't allow the fuel pump to run for more than 2 seconds, that was my giveaway. I called Whittle up and he suggested a few things. First thing was to pull a spark plug and see if we were getting any spark. Nothing. Then I checked to make sure the EDIS was getting power, it was. So that's where I'm at right now. I've got a bit to do tomorrow, I need to diagnose why I'm not getting spark. I'll check a few things first, see if perhaps the VR sensor is wired backwards, which would cause this. I'll also check to make sure I have the VR sensor in the correct location. I'm taking off from work tomorrow to try and finish things up on the car this weekend so I can race on Sunday. We'll see if I reach my goal! Overall I was very pleased with the progress tonight, even if the car didn't start I gave it a shot, turned it over and everything seems to work minus the spark issue. We'll see how things go tomorrow and I'll post video from tonight's attempt and hopefully tomorrow's success. "

    "body": "2007/07/27 - Well, Wednesday night was an eventful night. When I got home from work I jumped under the car and tried to track down my coolant leak. I found small traces of coolant here and there, but I didn't find any big problems. While under the car I found a few other things. I noticed that the oil return line off the bottom of the turbo wasn't hooked up. Thankfully I found that, had I tried to start the car with that disconnected we would of had a real mess on our hands. I found the coolant leak I was looking for, it, like the first coolant leak we found on Tuesday night, was in the thermostat housing. There was a plug in the housing that hadn't been covered in teflon and hadn't been tightened down enough either. After that I started to hookup the vacuum lines for the wastegate to the turbo. Once I had finished under the car I decided it was time to track down the fuel leak in the rail. We initially though that the first 3 injectors were leaking on the rail, so I spent an hour notching the fuel rail brackets so that I could lower the rail close to the intake manifold more, adjusting the angle of the injectors. This ended up not being the cause of the leak, but I do believe that the angle of the injectors is now much better than before as they sit in the rail and intake much better now. The cause of the fuel leak ended up being the 45 degree fitting we had on the inlet end of the rail. When removing the fitting on the rail I found that both the threads on the fitting and the rail were bunged up really good. There was no reusing the fitting so I would have to get another one and retap the rail. Here's the video I took of the work tonight. "

    "body": "2007/07/25 - Fuel leaks, coolant leaks and blown fuses. That about sums up the evening. . . First off, a HUGE thanks to everyone who came over tonight. Henry, Ronnie,&nbsp;Terec, Ian, Eric, Scott and Andy, without you guys helping out I wouldn't have gotten&nbsp;anything done&nbsp;tonight! Here's a basic summary of how things went tonight. Henry and Ronnie showed up first and got to work on finishing the wiring in the engine bay. They by far did the most, if not all of the work on the wiring on the car, I had put together three wires, but they as a team crank though some things, far faster that I could ever hope to. While they spent time working on the wiring in the engine bay I did a little work in the passenger compartment trying to get some wires run, finding parts for them, and trying to close up some ports on the intake before the turbo but after the MAF. Before heading to the interior to do wiring Henry, Ronnie and I attempted to crank the starter, to see if it would fire. Because this car is now a manual, but originally was an auto Ronnie wired up a relay to bypass the neutral safety switch that keeps the starter from firing if the car isn't in park. We were unable to locate the stock relay but found some of the wiring so we just ended up bypassing the whole thing. When they were working on the interior wiring I finished up some of the engine mount bolts that needed tightening and started cleaning up the Ford plug wires that I had picked up from the junk yard a while back. The rest of the guys started showing up, when Whittle called me I told him we were about half an hour from trying to start the car, he's the megasquirt Guru so I asked him to come over and assist us with things while we tried. By the time he arrived we weren't quite ready, but we thought we were close. Once the Whittle's showed up we ran some fuel through the fuel system into a jug (rather than the fuel rail) to try and clean out the hoses and pump, to keep any buildup from getting into the rail and injectors. That testing went fine, but as soon as we hooked the fuel lines back up and sent some pressure through the system we found a few leaks. The fittings at the fuel filter in the engine bay had been put together without teflon, lesson learned, 10 minutes later it was all back together again and pressure testing started up. Then we found a bigger issue, but one that didn't dump near as much fuel out. We can't seem to get the injector for the number 1 cylinder sealed into the fuel rail, it looks like the 2 and 3 injectors are also leaking a bit. So, tomorrow, the fuel rail will come off and we'll try to make adjustments. On the electrical side of things: At first we couldn't get the MS to fire up at all with the power from the car. After about 15 minutes, and Whittle about to give up I started looking for wires and remembered, we ran the TPS and TPS Signal wires, but don't currently have a TPS to hook up to, well sure enough, they were sitting right on the intake manifold. As soon as I removed them the Squirt fired up in Megatune. Then there were a few other gremlins. The MS seemed to be getting power spikes, though not completely resetting itself and firing the fuel pump again. At first we thought this was a grounding issue, but I believe I've now tracked it down just to be a source issue. While trying to track that down we started blowing fuses in the stock wiring. We couldn't figure out what that was happening until I looked at what we had wired into for the switched power line.  I found that we were jumped into a line for the AC, well two days ago I pulled the AC system from under the dash and the wiring was still there, half hanging out of the car, which of course was touching the chassis, and causing out problem. Once I figured that out I removed the AC wire from the equation. That corrected the fuse issue, but we're still getting the power fluctuations, so I'll be tracking those down by checking grounds tomorrow, and then by running a new switched line from the battery if the ground search doesn't prove fruitful. As Terec and I were putting things away in the garage and rolling the car back in I noticed some antifreeze that was pooled up on the steering rack bracket. At first I thought this was related to a loose plug that Terec had found earlier in the night, so we soaked up the pool and hoped that would be all we had to think of that. I got under the car though and started looking around with a paper towel, I swear I though I found a place where more coolant was collecting, which isn't a good sign. So we gave it all a good wiping down to try and dry it off, I'll look at it again tomorrow and see if there's more coolant, and if so try to track down that leak. So as of right now, in order to get this car running I need to: a) figure out the wiring issue b) figure out the fuel leak in the rail c) see if the coolant is still leaking and then fix the leak. Of those items right now, C scares me the most, I'm hoping I don't have to replace a head gasket or anything of the like. I'll have video up from tonight, both my usual format, and some HD video as well. "

After work my Henry (one of my bosses) and his mechanic buddy Ronnie came over to the house, after we made a quick pitstop at Gateway Electronics again to get more wiring items (I also spotted the Rally Bug builders on their way home from work). Ronny runs a shop down south near where he and Henry both live, so he was an EXCELLENT resource to have working on the car tonight. He and Henry got nearly every wire in the engine bay connected and placed in the appropriate areas, leaving just a few things for me to do in the bay. Eric also came over after making a trip to Autozone to get the battery for his 3rd gen RX-7 recharged. He finished up the fuel cell items that needed done. Adding the inline filter before the pump and then attached the vent line with the bulkhead fitting and check valve. I spent the evening doing minor things, mainly being in awe of all the work that Henry and Ronnie were getting done. I did track down some keys to the car, though I swear the keys I grabbed were the keys to the parts car I got rid of, one of them fit into the ignition for the 240z. I also figured out that the ignition has been turned on this whole time, which would explain why we never needed a key to turn the steering wheel when rolling the car around, though I'm not sure how it was turned on and the key removed. I do have the ignition out of the 78, as well as the turn signal and headlight switches from that car to try and use on the 73. Ronnie was able to get the power from the new battery hooked up to the starter, and alternator, which in turn got power to quite a bit of the car. One of the hazards work, the parking lights looked to work as when the headlights were turned on the rear lights lit up. I'll ahve to figure out how to wire up the headlights in the future, but I'm guessing the wiring for them should be somewhat intact based on testing tonight. So I've got more work to do tomorrow night. I'll try to finish up the wiring that is left in the engine bay, as well as wire up the fuse panel and try to mount the Megasquirt tomorrow night. Right now my goal is to try and start the car either Wednesday, or Thursday night! Though, I'm seriously thinking I won't be going to Topeka, though I'm still hoping to at take the car to the local autox this Sunday. "

    "body": "2007/07/23 - Here's a quick update on the 240. I got up this morning and finished up modifications to the bracket I built for the VR sensor, you can see what it ended up looking like in the photo below. It's not all that pretty, but not too bad considering I made it out of a drill press, vertical sander, and a jig saw.  I then ran out and spent a few more hours shopping. I went to autozone and purchased lots of random bits that I needed, another fuel filter (that didn't fit), wires, splices, antifreeze, radiator hose,&nbsp;oil, gear lube, and a ton of other random stuff. I also took the battery I had purchased for the parts car back to get tested, it wouldn't charge so they gave me a credit (it was out of the year's free replacement), so I got a new battery for $9. 95. Whittle came over and assisted with a few more wiring questions. &nbsp;From there I tried to get started on wiring. I began by looking where exactly I was going to run the wires, in order to find an existing hole to run them through I got up under the dash and started removing things on the passenger side. The first thing I removed ended up being part of the AC system, which I wasn't actually sure the car had! That opened up two holes, with grommets to boot, that allowed me to start running wires. Terec came over and started assisting with a few things, first thing we did when he got there was make a list of all the tasks left to do on the car. We used a sharpie on the windshield. After that he was visibly more productive today than I was. He actually mounted the sensor up to the motor and made sure that it was within specs to the 36-1 wheel. After that he was able to get the radiator mounted and the hoses attached to the proper locations. He then got the Oil Cooler mounted and the hoses finished up from what Eric started doing yesterday. You can see the oil cooler and radiator mounted in this photo.  I was able to get some of the EDIS wiring started, as well as power wires ran for both injector banks, as well as the Megasquirt harness wired into the engine bay, though the MS harness doesn't actually connect to anything yet. I have a LOT more wiring to do this week, hopefully getting most of it done Monday and Tuesday night with a goal of trying to start the car on Wednesday. We'll see if that happens, if I don't at least attempt to start it before Sunday I've vowed to shave my head. . . . Here are more photos from today.     "

While they were both productive, I actually never got my portion of the project finished last night, though I hope to finish it up tonight. Once the intake/exhaust and turbo was all back together we went ahead and began the task of putting the motor back in the car. I've got some High Definition video of that process here on this Video Page. With Eric and Russ' help we also managed to get the drive shaft connected up and the transmission into the cross member under the tunnel. Tonight I'm going to pick up more bolts, so we can mount the fuel cell bracket to the floor of the car and then we can hookup all the fuel lines. We'll also be installing the fuel rail and injectors tonight so we can hook up the fuel lined up front. At that point I hope to start trying to figure out the wiring for the car, that's the big project left for this weekend, get wiring going so we can try to start this bad boy up.

    "body": "2007/07/19 - Tonight Natalie and I went and looked at a house, it's got ~5 acres, a 2 stall barn, a hay shed, and an oversized two car garage. That covers the basics. While looking around in the garage I found a circuit breaker, sweet, setup just for the garage. It's even got a section marked &quot;Welder&quot;! score, 220 already wired in the garage. Where do I sign? I got home and finished dinner around 9 or 9:30pm, didn't feel much like working on the car. So, I didn't. Then I thought, well I had better check if the fittings I ordered last night would work on the oil cooler adapter. Guess what? They don't f'ng fit! I don't know who was smoking crack on the HybridZ Forums, but the oil cooler adapter plate's fittings are NOT 18mm, at least the 18mm x 1. 5 to 10AN fittings I got sure are too damn big. After I found that, all the stuff I had overnighted from Summit last night is pretty much useless, at least until I figure out what sizes I really need, or I just try to order another oil cooler adapter. That set me over the edge, I decided I was just going to try and take the oil filter adapter out of the block from my 78 280Z motor sitting on the floor of the garage. The other night I attempted to find two nuts to fit over this to aid in backing this adapter out, I failed at finding any. So I took my vice grips and clamped down, the adapter came out rather easily. I stuck that adapter into the block on the turbo motor, and stuck the oil filter on. Problem solved, no more oil cooler, at least not for now. Though I could have saved myself a few hundred bucks had I just done that two nights ago :( Later tonight I went back out to the garage (around 11:30) and started looking at how I'm going to fabricate my mount for the VR sensor to read the 36-1 wheel. I think I have a good setup figured out and will fabricate that immediately after work tomorrow so I can try to finish up any welding I may need to do (I think that's the last thing) because I know the Rally Bug will be needing the welder back soon! &nbsp; "

    "body": "2007/07/18 - Monday night I didn't get crap done on the project! I started to work on the oil filter/block attachment only to realize after driving around for 2 hours that I wasn't going to find any easy way to block off the oil cooler attachments for the 83 L28ET motor. By the time I got home from that it was well after 9 and I needed to spend some time with my wife. Tuesday I ordered AN fittings to go from the metric 18mm x 1. 5 oil cooler fittings to AN -10 fittings so that I can run steel braided lines to the new oil cooler I ordered. All of that should be here tomorrow. Tuesday after work I began putting things back together on the Intake Manifold. I spent far too long digging around the garage trying to find parts I haven't seen in a few weeks. Yes, I need FAR BETTER organization in the garage. I'll probably have to spend some time Thursday or Friday night cleaning up if I'm going to have anyone over to help out this weekend. After that I headed off to Speed Sports up in Bridgeton (http://www. speedsportstopfuel. com, store hours from 7-10pm M-F) to pick up some AN-4 steel braided line for my turbo oil feed. I got a 1/8&quot; NPT to AN-4 fitting, a 90 degree hose fitting, and the fittings I needed on the turbo side, as well as 5 feet (about 1 ft too much) of AN -4 hose. I figured out when I got home that the port on the block for the oil fitting is NOT 1/8&quot; NPT, it's actually 1/8&quot; BSPT, which is very similiar, but different enough to make my fitting not work. With this info, I think I've now figured out why the pipe thread plugs I had purchased a few months ago wouldn't work, I probably need BSPT for those as well. I've found a few parts online that I can order to convert from BSPT to NPT, I'll see if anyone locally has those tomorrow, otherwise I'll get those ordered tomorrow. After leaving Speed Sports I headed down the street to Autozone. At AZ I picked up a lot of hoses, clamps and other random bits of things I needed to reassemble the motor. I also picked up a GM open element Air Temperature sensor to thread into the Intake manifold to be able to tell what the air temp is going into the motor, I had to get the Wells part, I think SU107 was the # but I could be wrong. AZ didn't have a pigtail so I'll try Carquest tomorrow to see if they have the pigtail so I can wire this up to the megasquirt. When I got home I threaded the temperature sensor into the Intake manifold. I also managed to get the thermostat gasket installed into the housing, the GM Water Temperature Sensor installed into the Thermo housing, and cleaned up the snail for the turbo. It was a bit dirty from sitting in a barn for who knows how many years. I'll take pics of everything later this week. After running around this evening I got to thinking about how much this project has cost me lately. Without going into specifics (because my mother will read this) I've spent more this month than I spent to purchase the car. June was the same, and possibly double what I've spent so far this month. I know I've got a few more things I'll have to purchase, but hopefully I've got all the big items out of the way, at least for this phase of the project. More coming this week, and I promise to start doing video again!  "

    "body": "2007/07/16 - After yesterday's fun Eric and I spent some time in the garage today. I was awoken this morning around 8:00am by the doorbell, the Dish Network guy showed up right on time, more on that topic tomorrow on http://TheMadBlogger. org. After I got the Dish guy going I sent Eric an SMS to let him know I was out in the garage working. The first thing I need was to lay some fiberglass in the passenger floorboard. I had missed a few spots on that side earlier in the week, and layed some extra resin in the floor to smooth out the pockmarks from the cleaned up rust. &nbsp; While I let that dry I pulled the extra rear end that I had in the garage so I could start cleaning it up. As soon as I saw the rear end/suspension sitting in the driveway I immediately noticed a difference from the rear suspension that is on the car currently. The current suspension doesn't have a rear sway bar, the spare does. That's fine and dandy, I'd prefer the rear sway bar, the problem though is that the fuel cell frame that I fabricated fits right where the sway bar goes on this spare suspension. I'm not sure what I'll do with that aspect, but Eric and I spent the rest of the morning taking apart the spare rear suspension. We cleaned a lot of parts, figured out that the shocks (at least on the rear) are KYB's, they do look to be fairly new (or unused as that may be more correct). We got just about everything apart, and came up with plenty of parts to clean and paint (Powdercoat for Rande?)&nbsp;later in the project. Before I can use the rear swaybar I'm going to have to figure out what I'll need to change on the fuel cell bracket to make it work. I might be able to move the mounts for the bar a little higher to allow me to use the cell as currently fabricated. From there Eric and I started to prep for paint the interior. We cleaned up some of the dust that had gathered, drilled some pilot holes for the seat bolts in the floor (to get to the rear brackets for the seat mounts we had to cut a whole for a socket to fit through). We brushed, vacuumed, wiped and scrubbed the interior to try to get it ready for paint. We lowered the car down off the jackstands and spent the rest of the afternoon painting the interior with a nice satin black &quot;Chassis Saver&quot; paint that I had picked up on Saturday morning. I had purchased a gravity fed spray gun back in 2003 when&nbsp;I had the 350Z, previously using it once to spray some waste of money wax on the car, the gun hadn't been used since then. I think the paint this time around turned out great, an easy low cost solution that is WAY cleaner than it was prior to all this work. It was a bit laborious, but I think well worth the effort, Eric agrees. Here are some before pictures &nbsp;  And here are some after shots. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; There are more photos in my Flickr set for Project240z. com We ended up painting a few coats over most areas of the interior and then let the car sit for a while to dry. Once dry we rolled the car back into the garage and started running fuel lines. We ran both the feed and return lines for the fuel cell, mounted the pump again after removing it for paint, and fixed the fuel lines to the transmission tunnel. Tomorrow I'll be working on the motor again. I hope to get the intake and exhaust manifolds back on the motor so that we can put it in the car Tuesday or Wednesday night. From there it'll be time to start wiring up the Megasquirt. "

I used quite a few pieces of fiberglass matt on the passenger floorboard covering some of the holes. I also covered up a few of the sharper metal pieces of the floorboard.   On the driver's side I used minimal fiberglass matting and mainly used resin. The driver's side was in far better shape than the passenger side so I used resin to smooth out the surface on the driver's side. It turned out far better than I could have imagined! You can't really see it in the photos, but it's quite a clean look on the driver's side now. I can't wait to see how all this looks once painted.

    "body": "2007/07/02 - This morning I set out into the garage to tackle a fairly large task, at least in my mind. My goal was to build a frame that will secure my 15 gallon fuel cell to the Project 240Z. In case you don't want to read the rest of this post, I was successful! I began with a few shots of the car before I started cutting into it (further than I cut last weekend). There are various shots here, above and below. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; After taking those shots I got to cutting. Dave (from www. soloperformance. com) and I had discussed how to mount the cell into the car on Tuesday when he came over, so I had an idea of what I wanted to do. I quickly marked some lines to cut with a sharpie, then proceeded to tear up two cutting wheels removing metal from the rear of the car. I don't know why that stock metal tears up wheels, but they sure to go away quickly when cutting on the car. Here are photos of what was left after cutting.  &nbsp; The intention for the fuel cell frame was to bolt a bar on the back of the rear differential mount, weld to 1x1&quot; square tubes parallel to the ground running towards the back of the car, then come up at a 90 degree angle from those tubes with more square steel. Those two vertical posts would weld to a bar running inside the back of the car, this bar would also be bolted into the car, not welded, so that if necessary the whole frame can be pulled out with minimal effort. Here are a few pictures of the end result of the frame, as well as some of my crappy welds! I figured out with all but two welds done, that I had somehow adjusted the wirespeed on the welder in the wrong direction, and that was why I was having a horrible time. I think they''ll hold though, they just aren't very pretty! &nbsp;   This frame easily goes in and out of the car, which should come in handy if I ever need to remove the rear end (which I plan to when overhauling the suspension, after the car runs). Here are a few shots of the frame sitting in the car  And here is the end result, the fuel cell sitting in the frame, sitting in the car. &nbsp; I think the frame turned out great and I love this photo The tank sits just low enough, it is barely visible from the back of the car, I actually had to walk 10 feet back and down&nbsp;a couple&nbsp;feet of driveway incline to see either the tank or the frame itself. &nbsp; I've yet to bolt the frame to the car, but that can wait. I'll get some nuts, bolts, and washers tomorrow for the various things I need to mount, fuel cell, seats, etc. All in all I'm really impressed with myself,&nbsp;I got a lot more done this weekend than most weekends, though I still have the build the driver's side seat mounts, I finished the passenger side yesterday. What's next? Well like I said, tomorrow night I'll be building the driver's side seat mount, as well as visiting Mr. Whittle's house to test fit some fuel injectors into my new fuel rail that should be arriving and the old intake manifold. If the injectors he has fit I'll be ordering injectors on Tuesday. After that I'll be running fuel lines, and be working on putting the motor back together so I can attempt to put it back in the car next weekend if all goes well. That might be a lofty goal, but this whole project has been lofty for me, so why quit shooting high now! "

    "body": "2007/06/30 - Well, after figuring out that the seat mounts I had made earlier in the week wouldn't fit I went back out to work on the 240Z this morning with a bitter taste in my mouth. I started off with a few quick pictures of what I had put together the other day.  From there I removed the Corbeau brackets and started grinding the welds down on the tabs that I had added to the cross braces. I removed all four tabs with little trouble. Being that I haven't welded much before, this was the first time I'd had to remove a weld, so I wasn't sure what to expect. Here is the end result after removing the tabs.  From there I got smart, I decided to do a bit more test fitting of the seat before I did any more welding. I attached the Corbeau bracket back to the seat and put it in the car, using towels to keep the seat clean.  For the new positioning I decided the seat brackets basically needed to come forward in the car 4 to 5 inches from the original tabs I had made. With the two cross braces in place I wasn't comfortable making tabs that long and with little support, so I installed two more cross braces into the car, in front of the two existing braces. These two new braces were each welded at the body, and then to the original (from earlier this week) brace in the middle, actually reusing the tabs I had recently removed to add some support in the middle. I then welded on new tabs, this time spanning both braces on each half of the seat, adding support to the tab, as well as making the tab 2&quot; wide instead of 1. 5&quot; as I had originally made. This should create for better support of the seat brackets. Here are the photos of the newly created tabs and cross braces.    I position and drilled holes for the Corbeau bracket in the new tabs, visible in the latter photos above. After getting all of this setup I was anxious to get the seat in the car and see how she fit. To get the seat in the car I had to mount the Corbeau bracket directly to the seat with 4 bolts that will go through the new tabs in place. I wrapped the seat in towels and put on some clean latex gloves so that I wouldn't get the fabric dirty from all my gunk. In order to actually thread the nuts on the rear bolts I have to tilt the seat backward, for now this is alright, but when&nbsp;I actually go to use the seat this won't work well. What I think I'll do is get a combination of some rubber and metal washers, which I think will allow me to tighten the rear nuts down and still be able to tilt the base of the seat back a bit, once tight, lower the front of the seat into it's tabs and tighten up the bolts there. The front tabs are easy to access, the rear tabs, not so much. Anyways, here are the photos of the seat in the car.  &nbsp; Tomorrow I'll be installing the driver's seat, most likely in the same manner as the passenger side, I'll also be starting on mounting the fuel cell, cutting out sections of the rear floorpan, and then fabricating a frame for the cell to sit in. The ultimate goal for this 15 Gallon cell is to build&nbsp;a frame that will allow me to easily remove the fuel cell and install a smaller cell. Using the larger cell for Time Trial and HPDE events, and having a 5 gallon cell to use for autocross events, saving weight in the rear of the car. More tomorrow! "

First off, I marked the tabs on the seat mounts for drilling, drilled the holes, (all too close to the edges IMHO) only to figure out that I had marked the holes with the corbeau bracket turned sideway, so they were all off by 90 degrees. Easy enough, redrill 3 of the holes, one was even worse off than before, too close to an edge, but I figured wtf I might as well tighten them all down and mount the seat right? See some progress. Wrong. The seat won't fit. Long story short, be sure to measure everything before you go off and mount a seat! I'll be cutting off the tabs and welding on new tabs tomorrow/saturday. The new ones will point forward, bringing the seat forward on the new mounts, rather than backwards, this should create the room I need. Currently it's impossible to get the rear two bolts into the seat on the bracket, partially because I can't actually slide the seat back all the way because it hits the wheel well for the rear. I am glad I chose to do the passenger side first, this way I should have the process down pat for when I go to build the driver's side mounts this weekend. No pics, too pissed off tonight. "

I'm still waiting on my fuel rail from Lone Wolf Performance. I&nbsp;hope to hear from them tomorrow and have the part by Friday. If not I'll have to find myself another source for a fuel rail. Goals for this weekend. Mount both seats in the car, though I'll pull them back out until I'm ready to leave them in there for a while, they are too nice to keep in such a dirty car till it gets cleaned up! I'm also shooting for getting the fuel cell all fabricated and mounted into the car, along with fuel lines run to the front of the car. "

More on tonight in a bit. Summit Racing kindly sent me all of the fuel part oddities I had ordered last week. I had a 12x12 box sitting at the office when I returned&nbsp;from lunch today. I was dissapointed to find such a small box, after spending so much money! But I guess I did order &quot;small&quot; parts. After work I headed home and met up with Dave from http://www. soloperformance. com/ who came over tolend a hand. First we hypothesized on how to mount the 15 Gallon fuel cell I have for the car. I think we've come up with a good plan, and I hope to start fabricating that later this week. After going over that plan we started cutting and fabricating new seat mounts for the Project240z. We got quite a bit done on the Passenger side of the car. I started on that side just incase I were to screw something up, I can always drive without a passenger seat if needed, but I'll always need a driver's seat! Here's a link to the Video I took tonight. Towards the end you'll notice a small camera issue, the tape came loose and the camera basically inverted, which made for some kinda cool video as well. I also took some pictures of what we accomplished on the seat mounts.    Tomorrow night, or Thursday I plan to finish up the passenger side brackets and get started on the driver's side brackets, as well as to start cutting for the fuel cell. I'll have to pick up some more 4. 5&quot; cutting wheels though, I've gone through 3. 5 of them in the past two days of working on the car and have plenty more cutting left to do. I say tomorrow or Thursday, because I'm not sure I'll get any work done tomorrow (Wednesday) because I may head off and play roller hockey with some guys I used to work with at The Sporting News (www. sportingnews. com), they are in the process of relocating the &quot;online&quot; side of TSN to North Carolina and I think Wednesday night is the last night for Ray Slover at the pickup hockey games that have been going on for the past 5-6 years now. More later this week! &nbsp; &nbsp; "

I'm going to be ordering a fuel rail, injectors, pressure system/guage, and look into options for cleaning up the intake manifold.

I got a replacement sander and brought it home to install. I setup the webcam on the wall, right above the work bench, and got to work assembling the sander. 5-10 minutes later I was ready to start sanding on the aluminum I had cut with a jig saw the day before to make a blockoff plate for my AAC valve on the intake manifold. I tell you what, a vertical sander is a fun thing to have! Here's the result of what I was making, though I'm still going to drill a hole in it and tap that hole for the temperature sensor I'll be mounting in the intake manifold. &nbsp; I also got to use my new drill press to drill the holes in the plate, it all worked really darn well. After getting the plate made I decided it was time to remove the intake manifold from the car so I could tap and fill some of the holes on the manifold that I don't need to use. I brough the webcam with me and mounted it directly above the motor on the chery picker. I started removing bolts, then decided to read the haynes, it told me I need to remove the Turbo and a few other things to get the manifold removed, I guess I should of planned things a bit better and done most of this work BEFORE I put the engine back in the car, it sure would be a lot easier to get to. Once I realized how much I had to remove to get the manifold off I decided I didn't want to do all that last night, it was nearly 10pm by then. So I moved to the other side of the motor, bringing the camera with me to the other side. Andy and I decided last week to remove the attachments for the oil cooler for now, I'm going to attempt to get the car running without the cooler for now, and reinstall it down the road as I don't have all the hardware for it. So I started removing it last night, got it removed, and then saw that without the attachment there isn't a way to mount the oil filter to the block. So tonight I'll be attempting to remove the oil filter attachment from the parts motor (78 l28e) to see if I can use it on the 83 L28ET. After all this I decided it was time to head inside and play with the cool video I had shot last night, only to realize that I had click on the record audio button, instead of record video. So yet again, there isn't any video to be had :( Tonight though I promise I'll do my best to get it right and have a video to post of the evenings work. "

I did manage to get the drill press together Saturday morning, and I acquired a trailer Saturday morning. &nbsp; Sunday was a different story. I had planned on getting a lot done, but ended up sleeping all day. While it was nice, it was far from what I needed to get the car going. Tonight I went out with Russ and Matt Melton and Jeff &quot;The Jeweler&quot; Krekler, down to dinner in Soulard. From there I took Russ back to his house, saw his family, and came home with new motivation to get some work done on the car. I changed and went outside, setup the laptop to record video and go to work. I was cutting some aluminum scrap I picked up from the Metal Supermarket last Friday. I started making a new blockoff plate for the AAC valve on the L28ET intake manifold. I cut a rough pattern out with the jigsaw, made from tracing the bottom of the AAC valve with a sharpee and an awl to cut into the aluminum. I then went to assemble my new vertical belt sander that I purchased on Friday. The while taking it out of the box I noticed the darn thing was broken. Not likely broken to the point I couldn't use it, but I decided nonetheless to box it back up and take it back to Sears tomorrow to get a replacement. So that was the end of work tonight, I couldn't go any further on the plate and had some work to do on a few websites. I came inside to try to work on my video I recorded, but apparently managed to hose the video recording on the laptop by unplugging the camera before shutting off the software, so there's a tip, if you're using the lifecam software don't unplug the camera before you shut down the software, you're libel to lose your video.

That or perhaps I cut the well out and mount it, but that might be a future project. Whittle came over last night and we spent 3 hours going over the car and teaching me about relays and stuff about the Megasquirt. The squirt is nearly ready to install, he's adding a jumper to the board for the MAF, but other than that I think it's ready to go into the car as soon as I have all the wires run. I ran out tonight and picked up fuses, have yet to find a good fuse block though. I tried Autozone, they had something that might work but I had hoped to find something a little cleaner so I ran to Radio Shack and Walmart, neither place had any fuse blocks to use. I'll try a few more places tomorrow and see what I can locate. I really only need like 6 fuses but I bought plenty of spares. I need to fabricate something to mount the fuse block and a couple of relays too. I'm thinking some sort of black plexiglass/lexan or acryllic of some sort, though I'm not sure where to even begin looking for something like that in town, so they might just get bolted down to a piece of sheet metal for the time being. So what's next? Here are my goals for this weekend.    Get the fuel cell mounted and lines ran, I ordered a fuel pump from Jegs yesterday, should be tomorrow or Friday.    Remove the oil cooler attachments for now and screw on the filter in place of the adapter, I'll run without one for a bit, once I plan on having the car driving for more than 15-30 minutes at a time (1-3 minutes for autocross) I'll look at oil cooler options   Mount the VR sensor for the Megasquirt   Mount the radiator and get hoses that will work.    Get the other set of front rotors turned and put back on the car w/ new bearings.  Pictures and video of this weekends work coming early next week! As for what's after this weekend? Well getting all the wires for the Megasquirt run! Hopefully Nick can assist me with that next week over a few nights and we'll see if I can't get this darn car ready to run!

I had decided over the weekend I needed to take out all of the interior, or at least most of it, and clean up the inside of the car. I can always get the outside painted later, but the inside, if I'm going to be in it, needs to be cleaned up, and painted. It's orange, or red, I can't tell which, and though most of the interior items cover the orange there are gaps that show through. So I took out all the diamond plate looking black vinyl, and then started removing the tar board and furry coating over the transmission tunnel. I've removed all that I think I can remove right now, and eventually will also pull the dash out and replace the dash with a fiberglass dash I acquired when I purchased the car. While sitting in the car I had a lot of time to think, and based on the state of the car (old, rusty, partially assembled) I have decided that I won't be building the car up to SM2 rules anymore. I'll be aiming for the new XP class in SCCA Solo. By going to XP, I no longer have to worry about a few major things that I was concerned with. I don't have to deal with the interior anymore, I can do whatever I want (I think), so I can do something custom inside, without having to worry about SM2 rules about interiors. Moving to XP also frees up my options with mounting my seat. With SM2 mounting my seat like I plan to mount it may not have been legal, it'd have been a grey area, but within the rules of XP I believe I'll have all sorts of options for mounting the seat and remaining in the rules. So, XP here I come. I still plan to compete in SM2 for St. Louis region autocrosses this year, at least 4 more in SM2, then I'll try to run the 240Z in XP, unless of course I just talk myself into running XP for enough events to qualify for a year end class championship.

That's what I keep telling myself, though they brakes still need a lot of work! We did get the new (rebuilt) master cylinder installed, and bled, and apply braking force on the discs/drums! We ended up with a hodgepodge of brake/clutch systems. The vacuum boost is from the 73 240z, the master cylinder is a rebuilt cylinder for a 78 280Z, the clutch is from a 78 280z as the 73 240z was originaly an auto. Catch all that? Both systems are bled and semi ready. The brakes need to be pulled off the car, probably get the discs turned next week, and see what I need to do with the rear drums/shoes. Eventually I'd like to go to a 4 wheel disc setup, but that will have to wait until I have the cash to do a full suspension setup, most likely a setup from www. arizonazcar. com.

Steven is going to get the wheel mounted to the pulley. We also ran around getting other parts. We got some aluminum to fabricate blockoff plates for the various items we'll be removing from the motor, distributor, EGR valve, etc. &nbsp; We removed the Air Inlet Pipe, running from the Turbo to the Throttle Body as the grommet there looked to be torn. Removing it we found that to be the case, as well as that it appears to not be formed properly, possibly abused by a previous owner. I took the angle grinder to the car as well removing from rust from in front of the rear driver's side wheel. &nbsp;I then, for the first time in my life, applied Bondo to try to cover some of the holes left behind by the rust. I'm going to sand it down tomorrow and try to spray it with primer to to keep some of the rust from forming again. Dad ran new fuel lines for most of the rubber lines. We also bought some hardware to fabricate the throttle controls as the linkage from the parts car and this car don't quite match up together. Tomorrow I'm going to work on the floors and see what I rust I can remove and cover them up with a fresh coat of paint. &nbsp;More photos posted on the Photos page! &nbsp; "

Sooooo, now we're trying to verify that we can use the recently purchased rebuilt brake master cylinder for the 78 booster, on the 73 booster, without any issue. We'll see how that goes! After work today I ran to Illinois again to hit the Speedway salvage yard up for more parts as well. I picked up 3 wiring harnesses for the fuel injectors for the L28 motors. 1 set was off my old parts car, another off a 78 coupe that was there and another set off an 82 I believe. I'm hoping with all those connectors I can come up with at least 6 that are good enough to use to start the car up. After the junkyard I hit up Carquest to pickup the rebuilt master cylinder, it was actually just about the same price as a rebuild kit, so buying the already built one made too much sense. Hopefully tomorrow we can get that rest of the brake and clutch items squared away.

The brake MC has some corrosion inside, so I'll be ordering a rebuilt MC tomorrow that I should be able to pickup tomorrow night.

Over the afternoon and early evening Dad and I managed to seperate the 5spd transmission from the 78 motor and put it onto the 83 motor. From the looks of things the 83 motor was either once powering an automatic tranny, or was prepped to perform that work as we had to replace the driveplate with the flywheel/pressure plate from the 78 motor as well. After getting the transmission together and putting some of the parts I scavanged from the 78 motor Dad and I managed to get the motor into the Project 240z. I must say, removing motors is far easier than actually putting them back in the car. We put bolts into the motor mounts, and also into the crossmember underneath the transmission to hold it all in place, but have yet to tighten anything down just yet.  The megasquirt equipment should be here soon, hopefully. I've still gotta find a few parts for the ignition/fuel system. My goal is still to fire up the car next weekend, though I'm going to need a lot of help to do that.

Dave needed it for a week or so, and all I've been doing with it is using it as a nice engine hanger lately. After that quick trip I grabbed Natalie, hopped in the Tahoe and headed up North.

Both towing trips were uneventful, which was nice, though each car did shift around on the trailer a bit. The Tahoe towed fine, which is great! Though, I still want to see about getting a gooseneck trailer at somepoint to tow with the F350. On the way home from the super secret storage facility I decided to stop and double check the straps, just to make sure&nbsp;I wasn't going to lose my baby. I stopped out in front of this great sign ;) &nbsp; &nbsp; After getting home, Natalie and I unloaded the 240 from the trailer, though, not before I took the time to sweap the 5lbs of rust that the parts car had deposited on the floor of the garage. After rolling her into the garage and test fitting a few of the interior pieces we headed back up north to drop James' trailer off. They weren't home, lucky for them. Had he been home he might have had a heart attack watching me back the trailer in, I ended up parking it about 6 inches from the front of the STi, that darn slopped trailer, makes it hard to judge distances. Lucky for me&nbsp;I stopped when I did, otherwise I would have felt like a complete ass for borrowing a trailer and then hitting the owners car when returning it. More on the Project240z car later this week! "

I also completely removed the dash, pedal assembly, the master cylinders for the clutch and brakes. I also removed the hatch lock, and driver's door lock with hopes that I can reuse those in the 240 since I have&nbsp;a set of keys for the 280. Tomorrow I have to pull the diff out of the rear, and remove the passenger door lock, then it'll be time to load it up on the trailer and haul it off to the scrap yard.  No video today, I wanted to just get some work done without going through the hassle of setting up the camera. Perhaps I'll use it tomorrow when I finish up. "

I really didn't want to do any work today, but I forced myself to at least do a little. After doing that little work I started trying to figure out how I can get rid of the parts car. I drove over to Hall Street, and found no one over there to take it. So I headed to Illinois and Speedway said they would take it. So next weekend it's making a trip to Illinois for it's final resting place. After that I headed to Sauget to do some inventory on the 240Z, and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised! I had forgotten how much of the stock interior actually remained in the car. I was very happy to find that the headliner, center console, dash, and some of the tunnel interior still there, which makes my life a WHOLE lot easier to get it legal for SM2 in SCCA Autocross. So I only have to order a few things, rather than a complete interior which I was having trouble finding! More work tomorrow, I need to finish up the 280Z tomorrow as I'm going to be on the East Coast all of next week. "
