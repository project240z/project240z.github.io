"Paint and Assembly, working on the new motor",paint-and-assembly-working-on-the-new-motor,"<p>Last week Dad and I worked on the motor a bit, then I got sick and work pretty much halted. Today I started on what I had hoped to do last Sunday, cleaning up and reassembling motor bits.</p>  <p>Here's a list of the things I did today, or attempted to do :)</p>  <p>Painted the oil pan. Last week dad and I took the Oil pan from the L28ET motor to the car washed and tried to clean it up, it had a lot of left over motor parts in it from the destruction, and I also noticed that the pan itself had taken a beating during the desctruction, though it only put a few dents in the bottom, no punctures.I cleaned up some of the inside of the pan today and then painted the bottom with some 1200 degree flat black. After painting it I cleaned up and installed a new gasket and attached the pan to the block. I did figure out that I had to change the oil pickup from the L28ET to the L28E, so that the turbo pan would attach properly.

Into the motor we go,into-the-motor-we-go,"<p>So my parents are in town for a few days. Dad and I spent some time working on the motor for the 240Z today. I'll try to take some pictures tomorrow.</p>  <p>We pulled the valve cover off, as well as the oil pan, to look things over on the motor. So far things look good, though we could see quite a bit of crap sitting above the valves, mostly dead bugs and such. I tried to get them out with a combination of the air compressor and a shop vac, tomorrow I'll know if it worked. We also removed the oil pan and made sure things down there were alright. We'll check the torque on bolts tomorrow and then put the oil pan from the Turbo motor back on.</p>  <p>One thing I noticed, the 78 L28E has round exhaust ports while the 83 L28ET that died had square, so I'll have to do some research and see if the intake/exhaust manifolds should work on that 78 head or not.&#160;My plan was to take the turbo/exhaust setup from the 83 and put it onto the 78, hopefully tomorrow.</p>  <p>Other than that, we tried replacing the rear main seal, though I think the one we put in will probably leak more than the one we took out so I've ordered another one. We did all this with the motor on the engine stand which limited our access to the seal, when I have the motor back up on the cherry picker we'll replace the seal before attaching the flywheel and transmission.</p>",2008-03-23 03:40:45.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/259/Into-the-motor-we-go

Taking apart the new motor,taking-apart-the-new-motor,"<p>So Nick came over this morning and helped me get the motor off the ground and onto the engine stand so I could begin tearing it apart. After breaking a bolt off in the head trying to get one of the mounts setup for the cherry picker we managed to get the motor up and off the ground, though it took a couple of tries because we tried to get by with ""the wrong"" parts, meaning bolts in the chain that were too small for what we were doing.</p>  <p>Lesson learned, again, use the right damn tools, instead of trying to make the wrong tools work. You'll save time rather than trying to take short cuts.</p>  <p>Once we had the motor up on the stand he headed home to work on this car and I started trying to get the motor cleaned up a bit. Here are two before shots, of the front of the motor just caked in dirt and crap.</p>  <p><span class=""photo_container pc_m""><a title=""L28E"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/2321885405/""><img class=""pc_img"" height=""160"" alt=""L28E"" src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3170/2321885405_288c8607c0_m.jpg"" width=""240"" /></a></span>&#160;<span class=""photo_container pc_m""><a title=""L28E"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/2321882971/""><img class=""pc_img"" height=""160"" alt=""L28E"" src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2168/2321882971_558c29e1c9_m.jpg"" width=""240"" /></a></span></p>  <p>After spraying it down with degreaser and scrubbing with a wire brush I decided to finish what I started yesterday and remove the manfolds from the side of the motor. That actually went fairly easily, I'm not sure why, perhaps loading up the bolts with WD-40 yesterday before I finished helped, some of them almost seemed loose before I even cranked on them, perhaps Eric or I started to remove them last year when working on the other motor?</p>  <p>After getting the manifolds off I took off the last remaining attached item to the side of the motor, but honestly, I'm not sure what it was? At first I assumed it was a power steering pump, but the more I think about it the more I think it might have been the AC compressor?</p>  <p>After that I tried to spend some time organizing the garage a bit. I managed to get a few things hung up on the wall and made more room in there for the Corvette. I've still yet to make enough room to bring the 240Z home from storage. I don't think I'll be able to park both cars in the garage until I have the motor in the 240, otherwise I'll never have room in there for both cars and the motor, plus transmissions.</p>  <p>Speaking of transmissions, I need to sell the 2 extra ones I have, if anyone is looking for an automatic transmission out of a 73 240Z, or a 5 speed out of a 280Z let me know. I was told the 5 speed needs rebuilding, I have no clue about it other than that.</p>  <p>My goal/plan right now is to tear down the L28E and check things over, replace the rear main seal, make sure to clean it out, then try and put it all back together. I don't imagine I'll get that done before May, but I would like to spend time on it over the next few weeks if I can.</p>",2008-03-10 08:53:36.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/262/Taking-apart-the-new-motor
A space heater and gasoline...,a-space-heater-and-gasoline,"<p>Today Nick and I ran around town, getting some metal for his 240Z, then around to find a few other supplies that he needed.</p>  <p>When I got home I was half motivated to work on the car! So I went out to the garage, after sitting on the couch for 30 minutes, and got to working. It's still cold here in St. Louis so I had the garage door closed and decided to plug the space heater in to warm it up a little bit.</p>  <p>I put together&#160;a little rolling stool that I purchased from Sears a few weeks back (please don't visit <a href=""http://www.slickdeals.net"">www.slickdeals.net</a>, that site will make you spend more money at Sears than you ever have before). After putting the stool together I decided I should get to work on the motor.</p>  <p>What motor? This motor is out of a 78 280Z 2+2. The parts car, it ran when I got it, so the plan right now is to transfer the turbo/intake/fuel system from the blown 83 motor to this motor.</p>  <p>So I started on the motor, working on taking the fuel rail off the motor, along with the injectors and such (all this will be for sale later this week).&#160;I had most everything removed so that I could pull the fuel rail and injectors when I found one hose that was still hooked up to the intake manifold. Being that the motor is 30 years old some of the hoses and clamps are a little hard to remove, easy enough fix, I got a pair of dykes and started cutting.</p>  <p>Out pours some gasoline, which I found odd that there was still any fuel in the system. A few moments later when more fuel poured out I realized that the space heater was sitting less than 2 feet from where the fuel was hitting the floor.</p>  <p>Talk about getting your heart rate going, I jumped, grabbed the space heater and lifted it off the ground, quickly unplugging it and removing it from the area.</p>  <p>Thankfully nothing caught fire! That would of sucked! More work tomorrow, I'm going to try and get the motor up on an engine stand so I can replace the rear main seal which leaks, and try to check everything over before I put it all back together.</p>  <p>I could ""possibly"" have this motor running by the end of the month in the car. But I know how lazy and busy I am, so I have no doubts that there is no way I'll get all that done :) More info and pictures tomorrow, possibly even a new 240Z video!</p>",2008-03-09 04:52:43.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/263/A-space-heater-and-gasoline

Time to start,time-to-start,"<p>So I think the time has come. I hope to begin work on the 240Z again this week. First step, finish taking apart the blown motor and find the missing piston! Next step after that, start to take apart the L28E motor sitting on the floor. It's been sitting for almost a year now, and I've learned my lesson about not taking a look at what you have (see previous &quot;First step&quot; above).</p>  <p>So I hope to get the L28E motor somewhat apart so that I can replace the seals on it, and hopefully see what shape it is in. I'd hate to put a bunch of time into it only to find it's toast already. I know it ran, I drove the car it came out of, and I'm sure Lynn took good care of it, but I should really take some time with the motor this time so I don't get 40 seconds of time out of it! Now, to be fair, the old motor ran for probably a good 25 to 30 minutes total. It just got to drive for about 5 minutes, and 40 seconds of an autocross run. (Why oh why didn't I have the wife shooting Video instead of pictures?)</p>  <p>Nick, if you're reading this and you aren't working all weekend I hope to see you and the new friend over here this weekend! At least on Saturday, Sunday I should really spend time with the wife for our first Wedding Anniversary!</p>",2007-11-28 10:27:12.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/266/Time-to-start

We've been talking for the past few weeks about what to do with the Project240z, here are a few of the options we've discussed.</p>  <ol>      <li>Buy an LS1 and drop it in and continue to run in XP</li>      <li>Buy a 5.3 Vortec out of a Tahoe and continue to run in XP</li>      <li>Drop in the 78 280Z motor in the garage and run FP</li>      <li>Sell the car and buy one of the following to run      <ol>          <li>C5 Z06 to run in SS</li>          <li>06+ Mustang GT to run in FS</li>      </ol>      </li>  </ol>  <p>Well, I think option 4.1 is leading the pack right now.</p>  <p>Though my goal is to have the 240Z running by the end of October. My plan is to pull the bad motor out of the car tomorrow, and start replacing the leaky seal in the motor out of the 78 parts car.</p>  <p>Get the 78 motor together, fuel injection setup off the Turbo motor, possibly the turbo, intake and exhaust over as well.</p>  <p>Install the 78 in the car, get the car running, paint the car, sell the car.</p>  <p>We'll see where I end up, but I'm definitely keeping my options open.</p>",2007-09-30 10:04:48.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/270/The-240Z-has-life?
"A day late, dollar short? LS1?",a-day-late-dollar-short?-ls1?,"<p>Well, I was excited when I got up this morning. I thought i was going to go look at a LS1 motor for the 240z... But as of a few minutes ago I think the motor won't be there when I go to look at lunch today.</p>  <p>We'll see, I may luck out and it may not be sold yet, but I was informed someone was coming to pick it up already. If not, if it looks good, I'll probably be purchasing the next powerplant for the Project240z today.</p>  <p>Last night I spent some time in the garage, trying to clean up and get parts ready for an ebay explosion. More on the ebay parts later this week.</p>",2007-08-29 18:51:02.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/271/A-day-late-dollar-short?-LS1?

Who needs a steering wheel?,who-needs-a-steering-wheel?,<p>Over the time working on the 240Z we had various problems getting the steering wheel mounted in the car properly. The steering column threads wouldn't allow the Nut that I had to thread onto the column so mounting the wheel was an issue.</p>  <p>Last night I found another nut for the column and believed that I got it threaded onto the column with a lot of brute force. Well it ends up that brute force basically destroyed the threads on the column. So... I guess I'll add a new steering column to the list of things&nbsp;I need for the car.</p>,2007-08-17 19:46:11.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/273/Who-needs-a-steering-wheel?
Project240Z Post Traumatic Stress Analysis,project240z-post-traumatic-stress-analysis,"<p>I went out to the garage tonight with the hopes of trying to figure out what went wrong on Sunday.</p>  <p>I was going to take the valve cover off and see if I saw anything out of the ordinary, then pull the head if I could get to that. Before doing those two things though I figured I should drain the oil out of the motor. Much to my suprise when I drained the oil it wasn't oil that came out first, it was coolant, then oil followed.</p>  <p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/1121489208/""><img height=""160"" alt=""Drained"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1107/1121489208_b95723354c_m.jpg"" width=""240"" /></a>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Once I discovered that I began to lose hope that I would be able to salvage anything in this motor. Thoughts of a cracked block filled my head. Nevertheless I proceeded forward with removing the valve cover and whatever else I could get to.</p>  <p>When I pulled the cover off I started looking around and immediately found something that looked out of place. Ends up I found two things out of place, two of the rocket arm guides were laying on the cylinder, with a little Matlock work I found that both the guides from the #2 cylinder were not in the correct place.</p>  <p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/1121928912/""><img height=""160"" alt=""Missing Guides"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1295/1121928912_e64a78ead2_m.jpg"" width=""240"" /></a>&nbsp;</p>  <p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/1121096163/""><img height=""160"" alt=""The Missing Guides"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1160/1121096163_380c044e99_m.jpg"" width=""240"" /></a>&nbsp;</p>  <p>From there I didn't get too far, I did get the timing sprocket and chain removed, and ended up getting the camshaft remove as well, but I was unable to see anything out of the ordinary. I even tried sticking a magnet into the spark plug hole on the #2 cylinder with hopes of pulling some bits of metal out of there, hoping to find something awry.</p>  <p>No dice,&nbsp;so I'll have to wait until this weekend to get further on the investigation. I'm going to have to pull the motor out of the car in order to take the manifolds off so that I can remove the cylinder head and see what happened on Sunday.</p>  <p><a href=""http://www.project240z.com/tabid/54/itemid/32/Post-Traumatic-Stress-Analysis.aspx"">Here's a link to the video of me working in the garage tonight.

One week after ignition,one-week-after-ignition,"<p>So it's been over a week now since I drove the 240Z for the first time. What have I gotten done in that timeframe? Not much!</p>  <p>I basically didn't touch the car until Thursday, and all I did then was take a few minutes to inaccurately measure the requirements for the flange on the downpipe. Friday I picked up a header collector flange from my buddy Russ' place. Sunday morning I went to work on that flange, it needed some help to make it fit.</p>  <p>Sunday afternoon I spent some time in the sauna, I mean garage. I managed to get the coil pack and EDIS module mounted to the fender. I then started trying to clean up some of the wiring in the engine bay. I got some plastic loom a while back so I started running that to cover up the mess of wiring in the engine bay. I also ran the loom in the passenger compartment around some of the wiring in there. It's not finished, but it's definitely starting to look better.</p>  <p>Dad helped me to put a switch inline for the main relay. Luckily with the car not idling yet I haven't had problems turning the car off, but with the way things were wired if the car was idling properly you'd have to pull a fuse or disconnect the battery to shut off the car. Now that I have a switch it's easy to do!</p>  <p>After that Dad and I put the hood and hinges on the car, the first time since I've owned the 240 that it has had a hood attached! From there we loaded the car up onto the trailer later in the evening.</p>  <p>This morning I got up early (a rarity for me) and took the car/trailer over to the Carx on St. Charles Rock Road in Bridgeton. Rick was extremely helpful over there and by 12pm today I was back up there loading the car up on the trailer with Eric's help. Carx put a 3&quot; pipe from the downpipe back to the rear axle, with a turndown on the end.</p>  <p>It's still quite loud, but if I do say so myself, it sounds pretty damn sweet! Eric and I brought the car home, and before trying to push it off the trailer I finally got it started. I'm having starter issues and will probably try to replace the starter Thursday or Friday of this week.</p>  <p>I drove the car off the trailer and into the garage, it's a beautiful sound!</p>  <p>I'm still aiming to <s>compete</s> drive&nbsp;the car at the Autocross on Sunday. Before I can do that I have quite a bit left to do.</p>  <p>1. Fix the idle (longer idle screw)<br />  2. See if there's any fluid in the transmission (can't get the fill plug out so I've not pulled the drain plug yet)<br />  3. Build a bulkhead/firewall for the fuel cell<br />  4. Finish up wiring for the O2 sensor<br />  5. Get a harness squared away<br />  6. More stuff I'm sure I've forgotten!</p>",2007-08-07 01:20:24.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/280/One-week-after-ignition

Today was a good day!,today-was-a-good-day,"<p>This morning I woke up with a little hope in my eye, hope that I would make some good progress today.</p>  <p>After doing some reading online about the Megasquirt and Edis I headed out to the garage. The first thing I noticed was that the coil pack wasn't plugged into the Edis module. I'm not sure if I had unplugged it last night when trying to figure out why we didn't have any spark, or if I hadn't plugged it in at all last night.</p>  <p>I then hooked up the laptop and tried to start the car, to see if anything changed. At first nothing was different than last night, no spark and no RPM signal on the squirt. But a few tries later I noticed the RPM on the laptop jumped up. Sporadically I was able to get RPM but nothing consistant or worth a darn from a starting perspective.</p>  <p>I decided from there I would need to mount the coil pack and the edis module as I hadn't mounted them yet, they were just laying in the car. To do that I needed to pick up some metal as I didn't have enough to fabricate much.</p>  <p>I headed out around noon to the DMV, it was time to get the trailer registered, and then head to Illinois to pickup the trailer, fix the wiring on the trailer, and then hit Home Depot on the way home to pick up the metal. The trailer pickup took far longer than I expected, but with the help of Andy and Chris Hohl I was able to get the wiring on the trailer fixed!</p>  <p>When I got home I backed the trailer into the driveway and got to work on the car again. Before I went ahead and started building brackets for the EDIS setup I decided to try and rewire the VR sensor on the car, to see if that might fix my problems. I checked a few things I had lying around. I had a VR sensor for a V6 Ford Explorer, but I was using the VR sensor that matched the 36-1 wheel off a 4Cylinder Escort that I had mounted to the car. I checked the wiring on both sensors and noticed that the colors were opposite on the Explorer plug.</p>  <p>After swapping out the VR sensor wires I went to fire the car up, sure enough I had a full RPM signal on the laptop! Score! I then started checking to see if I had any spark. Eric showed up and we weren't getting any spark. To try something out we plugged in the other coil pack and hooked up one wire/plug sitting on top of the valve cover. Once we did this we immediately noticed spark! Score again! Just to see if we had something else wrong we plugged back into the original coil pack, and sure enough this one also sparked. One thing we did to the original coil pack was to run a wire from one of the mounting points to the shock tower on the passenger side.</p>  <p>I'm not exactly sure what changed to cause us to start getting a spark, but I think it most likely related to this ground, perhaps, I'll test it out again tomorrow without the ground and see what happens.</p>  <p>Once we had spark we hooked the fuel pump back up and tried to get her to fire. First thing we started getting was a few pops and then lots of smoke! Score again! After a few attempted we decided we'd tried enough for the time being. Eric headed out and I decided I needed to try something else. I remembered reading today that the EDIS coil pack should run 132, and we had plugged in the wires for 123, so I swapped this around.</p>  <p>As soon as I attempted to start it was a totally different sound, it was beautiful! I've not yet gotten it to start, but it sure sounds like it's trying to. I had Andy Whittle on the phone throughout the night and I sent him a few log files from the data I recorded while trying to start the motor.</p>  <p>Around 10pm I figured it was probably a little too late to try to keep starting the car with all the noise it was creating. I got under the car and hooked up the speedometer cable, put the missing bushings into the transmission crossmember and tightened that up as well as the clutch slave cylinder.</p>  <p>I've got a few things to try in the morning before I head off to the muffler shop to see if I can't get an exhaust put on the car.</p>  <p><a href=""http://www.project240z.com/tabid/54/itemid/29/Trying-to-start-the-car.aspx"">Here's some video from tonight, trying to start the car.</a></p>",2007-07-28 10:10:17.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/283/Today-was-a-good-day
"Fuel Rail Fun! She turns, but has no spark",fuel-rail-fun-she-turns-but-has-no-spark,"<p>First off, let me say that today was a good day! It didn't start off that way  however. <a target=""_blank"" href=""../../../../../Blog/tabid/53/EntryID/85/Default.aspx"">After last night's fuel rail issues</a> I needed to get the rail  tapped and get myself a new fitting. At lunch I headed over to <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.soloperformance.com/"">SoloPerformance</a> World  Headquarters to have Dave assist with tapping the rail. He didn't have a 3/8 NPT  tap so I had to head over to Grainger down the street from the SPS offices and  pick up a tap. $33 later I was in business and heading back to Dave's. He  assisted with tapping the rail again and then I headed south.</p>  <p>I needed to go to SCPRacingparts.com to pickup another fitting, they had just  what I needed and then I was headed back to the office. When I got home this  evening the first thing I did was check to see if the new fitting would be what  I needed. I put the fitting into the rail with some teflon and hooked everything  up. I pressurized the fuel system, and sure enough, it was leaking fuel again!  Not a happy camper was I. With a leaking fuel rail I couldn't do much else so I  called up <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.speedsportstopfuel.com/"">Speed  Sports</a> to see if they could help me out by tapping the rail and selling me a  new fitting.</p>  <p>They were running a little late and not open yet so I decided to work on the  power issue we were having with the Megasquirt. On Tuesday we had problems  because the MS signal to the laptop was highly unsteady. We weren't sure if it  was a power problem, or if it was related to a bad ground. Tonight I replaced  the wire we were running to the main relay with a direct line from the battery.  Once I did this the relay kicks in immediately when plugged to the battery,  powering up the megasquirt without the ignition being on.</p>  <p>This corrected the fluctuation issue, which was great news! Now that the  gauges and sensors seem to work fuel was the last major hurdle before I could  attempt to start the car. I headed up to Speed Sports and had Lou tap the rail  and install a new fitting for me. He showed me that I wasn't using enough teflon  on the fitting, and he also managed to run the fitting nearly all the way in,  where we were only able to get it in a few threads before.</p>  <p>Once I had the new fitting installed I was starting to get excited, perhaps  it would hold and I'd be able to see what happens when I cranked the car.  Installation of the rail was easy, I've installed and removed it so much in the  past two nights that it is easy to do now. Eric showed up and we pressurized the  fuel system a few times. All tests appeared good, no fuel leaking out anywhere!</p>  <p>Now it was time, the power was good, the fuel was good, it was time to try  and start the car. Eric and I tied up a few last minute things, hooked up the  battery, computer to the Megasquirt and watched all the gauges on the PC light  up. Eric stood by the front of the car with a fire extinguisher and I reached  into the driver's door to turn the key.</p>  <p>I turned the key, she cranked over, a beautiful sound I must say. After a few  cranks I realized the fuel pump wasn't running, which meant that the squirt  wasn't getting an RPM signal as it should be. I looked over at the display and  sure enough, no RPMs registering on the PC. Without RPMs the Megasquirt won't  allow the fuel pump to run for more than 2 seconds, that was my giveaway.</p>  <p>I called Whittle up and he suggested a few things. First thing was to pull a  spark plug and see if we were getting any spark. Nothing. Then I checked to make  sure the EDIS was getting power, it was.</p>  <p>So that's where I'm at right now. I've got a bit to do tomorrow, I need to  diagnose why I'm not getting spark. I'll check a few things first, see if  perhaps the VR sensor is wired backwards, which would cause this. I'll also  check to make sure I have the VR sensor in the correct location. I'm taking off  from work tomorrow to try and finish things up on the car this weekend so I can  race on Sunday. We'll see if I reach my goal!</p>  <p>Overall I was very pleased with the progress tonight, even if the car didn't  start I gave it a shot, turned it over and everything seems to work minus the  spark issue. We'll see how things go tomorrow and I'll post video from tonight's  attempt and hopefully tomorrow's success.</p>",2007-07-27 10:31:04.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/284/Fuel-Rail-Fun-She-turns-but-has-no-spark
Wednesday Night Progress,wednesday-night-progress,"<p>Well, Wednesday night was an eventful night. When I got home from work I  jumped under the car and tried to track down my coolant leak. I found small  traces of coolant here and there, but I didn't find any big problems. While  under the car I found a few other things. I noticed that the oil return line off  the bottom of the turbo wasn't hooked up. Thankfully I found that, had I tried  to start the car with that disconnected we would of had a real mess on our  hands.</p>  <p>I found the coolant leak I was looking for, it, like the first coolant leak  we found on Tuesday night, was in the thermostat housing. There was a plug in  the housing that hadn't been covered in teflon and hadn't been tightened down  enough either. After that I started to hookup the vacuum lines for the wastegate  to the turbo.</p>  <p>Once I had finished under the car I decided it was time to track down the  fuel leak in the rail. We initially though that the first 3 injectors were  leaking on the rail, so I spent an hour notching the fuel rail brackets so that  I could lower the rail close to the intake manifold more, adjusting the angle of  the injectors. This ended up not being the cause of the leak, but I do believe  that the angle of the injectors is now much better than before as they sit in  the rail and intake much better now.</p>  <p>The cause of the fuel leak ended up being the 45 degree fitting we had on the  inlet end of the rail. When removing the fitting on the rail I found that both  the threads on the fitting and the rail were bunged up really good. There was no  reusing the fitting so I would have to get another one and retap the rail.</p>  <p><a href=""http://www.project240z.com/DesktopModules/EngagePublish/itemlink.aspx?itemId=28"">Here's the video I took of the work tonight.</a></p>",2007-07-27 09:53:11.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/285/Wednesday-Night-Progress
"Fuel, Water and Electricity *bangs head on wall*",fuel-water-and-electricity-*bangs-head-on-wall*,"<p>Fuel leaks, coolant leaks and blown fuses. That about sums up the  evening...</p>  <p>First off, a HUGE thanks to everyone who came over tonight. Henry,  Ronnie,&nbsp;Terec, Ian, Eric, Scott and Andy, without you guys helping out I  wouldn't have gotten&nbsp;anything done&nbsp;tonight!</p>  <p>Here's a basic summary of how things went tonight. Henry and Ronnie showed up  first and got to work on finishing the wiring in the engine bay. They by far did  the most, if not all of the work on the wiring on the car, I had put together  three wires, but they as a team crank though some things, far faster that I  could ever hope to.</p>  <p>While they spent time working on the wiring in the engine bay I did a little  work in the passenger compartment trying to get some wires run, finding parts  for them, and trying to close up some ports on the intake before the turbo but  after the MAF.</p>  <p>Before heading to the interior to do wiring Henry, Ronnie and I attempted to  crank the starter, to see if it would fire. Because this car is now a manual,  but originally was an auto Ronnie wired up a relay to bypass the neutral safety  switch that keeps the starter from firing if the car isn't in park. We were  unable to locate the stock relay but found some of the wiring so we just ended  up bypassing the whole thing.</p>  <p>When they were working on the interior wiring I finished up some of the  engine mount bolts that needed tightening and started cleaning up the Ford plug  wires that I had picked up from the junk yard a while back.</p>  <p>The rest of the guys started showing up, when Whittle called me I told him we  were about half an hour from trying to start the car, he's the megasquirt Guru  so I asked him to come over and assist us with things while we tried. By the  time he arrived we weren't quite ready, but we thought we were close.</p>  <p>Once the Whittle's showed up we ran some fuel through the fuel system into a  jug (rather than the fuel rail) to try and clean out the hoses and pump, to keep  any buildup from getting into the rail and injectors. That testing went fine,  but as soon as we hooked the fuel lines back up and sent some pressure through  the system we found a few leaks. The fittings at the fuel filter in the engine  bay had been put together without teflon, lesson learned, 10 minutes later it  was all back together again and pressure testing started up. Then we found a  bigger issue, but one that didn't dump near as much fuel out. We can't seem to  get the injector for the number 1 cylinder sealed into the fuel rail, it looks  like the 2 and 3 injectors are also leaking a bit. So, tomorrow, the fuel rail  will come off and we'll try to make adjustments.</p>  <p>On the electrical side of things: At first we couldn't get the MS to fire up  at all with the power from the car. After about 15 minutes, and Whittle about to  give up I started looking for wires and remembered, we ran the TPS and TPS  Signal wires, but don't currently have a TPS to hook up to, well sure enough,  they were sitting right on the intake manifold. As soon as I removed them the  Squirt fired up in Megatune. Then there were a few other gremlins. The MS seemed  to be getting power spikes, though not completely resetting itself and firing  the fuel pump again.</p>  <p>At first we thought this was a grounding issue, but I believe I've now  tracked it down just to be a source issue. While trying to track that down we  started blowing fuses in the stock wiring. We couldn't figure out what that was  happening until I looked at what we had wired into for the switched power line.  I found that we were jumped into a line for the AC, well two days ago I pulled  the AC system from under the dash and the wiring was still there, half hanging  out of the car, which of course was touching the chassis, and causing out  problem. Once I figured that out I removed the AC wire from the equation. That  corrected the fuse issue, but we're still getting the power fluctuations, so  I'll be tracking those down by checking grounds tomorrow, and then by running a  new switched line from the battery if the ground search doesn't prove  fruitful.</p>  <p>As Terec and I were putting things away in the garage and rolling the car  back in I noticed some antifreeze that was pooled up on the steering rack  bracket. At first I thought this was related to a loose plug that Terec had  found earlier in the night, so we soaked up the pool and hoped that would be all  we had to think of that. I got under the car though and started looking around  with a paper towel, I swear I though I found a place where more coolant was  collecting, which isn't a good sign. So we gave it all a good wiping down to try  and dry it off, I'll look at it again tomorrow and see if there's more coolant,  and if so try to track down that leak.</p>  <p>So as of right now, in order to get this car running I need to:</p>  <p>a) figure out the wiring issue</p>  <p>b) figure out the fuel leak in the rail</p>  <p>c) see if the coolant is still leaking and then fix the leak.</p>  <p>Of those items right now, C scares me the most, I'm hoping I don't have to  replace a head gasket or anything of the like.</p>  <p>I'll have video up from tonight, both my usual format, and some HD video as well.</p>",2007-07-25 11:30:59.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/286/Fuel-Water-and-Electricity-*bangs-head-on-wall*

Monday Monday Monday Progress!,monday-monday-monday-progress,"<p>Today was a good day! Progress was made! First things first, at lunch myself, <a href=""http://www.kenuam.com"">Henry,</a> and Eric headed down to High Ridge to SCPRacingparts.com again to get a cap for my Fuel cell, I realized yesterday that I was only 3 of the 4 fitting points for the fuel cell, and I had better get something to cover the fourth one up.</p>  <p>After work my Henry (one of my bosses) and his mechanic buddy Ronnie came over to the house, after we made a quick pitstop at Gateway Electronics again to get more wiring items (<a href=""http://www.321govideo.com/rallybug/"">I also spotted the Rally Bug builders on their way home from work</a>). Ronny runs a shop down south near where he and Henry both live, so he was an EXCELLENT resource to have working on the car tonight. He and Henry got nearly every wire in the engine bay connected and placed in the appropriate areas, leaving just a few things for me to do in the bay.</p>  <p>Eric also came over after making a trip to Autozone to get the battery for his 3rd gen RX-7 recharged. He finished up the fuel cell items that needed done. Adding the inline filter before the pump and then attached the vent line with the bulkhead fitting and check valve.</p>  <p>I spent the evening doing minor things, mainly being in awe of all the work that Henry and Ronnie were getting done. I did track down some keys to the car, though I swear the keys I grabbed were the keys to the parts car I got rid of, one of them fit into the ignition for the 240z. I also figured out that the ignition has been turned on this whole time, which would explain why we never needed a key to turn the steering wheel when rolling the car around, though I'm not sure how it was turned on and the key removed. I do have the ignition out of the 78, as well as the turn signal and headlight switches from that car to try and use on the 73.</p>  <p>Ronnie was able to get the power from the new battery hooked up to the starter, and alternator, which in turn got power to quite a bit of the car. One of the hazards work, the parking lights looked to work as when the headlights were turned on the rear lights lit up. I'll ahve to figure out how to wire up the headlights in the future, but I'm guessing the wiring for them should be somewhat intact based on testing tonight.</p>  <p>So I've got more work to do tomorrow night. I'll try to finish up the wiring that is left in the engine bay, as well as wire up the fuse panel and try to mount the Megasquirt tomorrow night.</p>  <p>Right now my goal is to try and start the car either Wednesday, or Thursday night! Though, I'm seriously thinking I won't be going to Topeka, though I'm still hoping to at take the car to the local autox this Sunday.</p>",2007-07-24 09:36:36.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/288/Monday-Monday-Monday-Progress
P240Z Sunday Wiring Starts,p240z-sunday-wiring-starts,"<p>Here's a quick update on the 240. I got up this morning and finished up  modifications to the bracket I built for the VR sensor, you can see what it  ended up looking like in the photo below. It's not all that pretty, but not too  bad considering I made it out of a drill press, vertical sander, and a jig  saw.</p>  <p class=""Photo""><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/872518561/""><img width=""240"" height=""160"" alt="""" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1089/872518561_ee2917d9ee_m.jpg"" /></a></p>  <p>I then ran out and spent a few more hours shopping. I went to autozone and  purchased lots of random bits that I needed, another fuel filter (that didn't  fit), wires, splices, antifreeze, radiator hose,&nbsp;oil, gear lube, and a ton of  other random stuff. I also took the battery I had purchased for the parts car  back to get tested, it wouldn't charge so they gave me a credit (it was out of  the year's free replacement), so I got a new battery for $9.95.</p>  <p>Whittle came over and assisted with a few more wiring questions.&nbsp;From there I  tried to get started on wiring. I began by looking where exactly I was going to  run the wires, in order to find an existing hole to run them through I got up  under the dash and started removing things on the passenger side. The first  thing I removed ended up being part of the AC system, which I wasn't actually  sure the car had! That opened up two holes, with grommets to boot, that allowed  me to start running wires.</p>  <p>Terec came over and started assisting with a few things, first thing we did  when he got there was make a list of all the tasks left to do on the car. We  used a sharpie on the windshield. After that he was visibly more productive  today than I was. He actually mounted the sensor up to the motor and made sure  that it was within specs to the 36-1 wheel. After that he was able to get the  radiator mounted and the hoses attached to the proper locations. He then got the  Oil Cooler mounted and the hoses finished up from what Eric started doing  yesterday. You can see the oil cooler and radiator mounted in this photo.</p>  <p class=""Photo""><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/873353908/""><img width=""240"" height=""160"" alt="""" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1205/873353908_e4809af1b0_m.jpg"" /></a></p>  <p>I was able to get some of the EDIS wiring started, as well as power wires ran  for both injector banks, as well as the Megasquirt harness wired into the engine  bay, though the MS harness doesn't actually connect to anything yet. I have a  LOT more wiring to do this week, hopefully getting most of it done Monday and  Tuesday night with a goal of trying to start the car on Wednesday. We'll see if  that happens, if I don't at least attempt to start it before Sunday I've vowed  to shave my head....</p>  <p>Here are more photos from today.</p>  <p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/872530883/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img width=""75"" height=""75"" alt=""A mess of wires!"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1223/872530883_26316591e1_s.jpg"" /></a> <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/872527971/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img width=""75"" height=""75"" alt=""A mess of wires!"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1113/872527971_dd62e028d7_s.jpg"" /></a> <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/872525013/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img width=""75"" height=""75"" alt=""A mess of wires!"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1182/872525013_0ac1db8473_s.jpg"" /></a> <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/872521791/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img width=""75"" height=""75"" alt=""L28ET Mess!"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1085/872521791_e1a508370d_s.jpg"" /></a> <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/872518561/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img width=""75"" height=""75"" alt=""VR Sensor Bracket"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1089/872518561_ee2917d9ee_s.jpg"" /></a> <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/872512225/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img width=""75"" height=""75"" alt=""VR Sensor Bracket"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1392/872512225_882694dc4f_s.jpg"" /></a> <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/873359360/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img width=""75"" height=""75"" alt=""VR Sensor Bracket"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1006/873359360_8922d469fe_s.jpg"" /></a> <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/873353908/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img width=""75"" height=""75"" alt=""Oil Cooler"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1205/873353908_e4809af1b0_s.jpg"" /></a></p>",2007-07-23 10:34:20.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/289/P240Z-Sunday-Wiring-Starts
Saturday Progress,saturday-progress,"<p>Eric and I got a bit done today. Mostly learning with the help of Andy Whittle who stopped by to assist with some Megasquirt questions. I also did some soldering on the Megasquirt wiring, LOTS more soldering to do tomorrow!</p>  <p>The fuel cell is mounted, Eric started on the oil cooler mounting, we ended up figuring out that I did have the correct peices for that, so all that money isn't wasted.</p>  <p>Sunday tasks</p>  <p>Connect Fuel Lines<br />  Run Megasquirt Wires, Fuses, Relays<br />  Install Megasquirt<br />  Install Fuse Panel<br />  Install Battery (charge battery)<br />  Install Seats<br />  Install Radiator<br />  Connect Starter<br />  Connect Alternator<br />  Add Oil to the Motor and Transmission<br />  Add Coolant<br />  I'm sure I'll have to add more to this list.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>",2007-07-23 10:33:54.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/290/Saturday-Progress
Another night of progress,another-night-of-progress,"<p>Today we made some good progress. Mark helped me at the office today to solder some more wiring for the megasquirt. I've still got a LOT more wiring to do, but that part of things is starting to come together.</p>  <p>Tonight I finished up welding for the VR sensor bracket and then Eric came over and we spent time connecting things in the engine bay. We have more of the fuel lines connect, oil feed for the turbo, and other things going now. I've got a few fittings to purchase Saturday morning, a few bolts to purchase, and grommets to fill some holes.</p>  <p>Saturday morning I'll be up early, running around for a few parts, then back home to finish up the fuel hardware. I'll start on running wires for the megasquirt tomorrow morning.</p>  <p>Mostly, after the fuel lines are taken care of, I just have electrical things to work on. Any EE's out there who want to come play tomorrow?????</p>",2007-07-21 10:12:38.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/291/Another-night-of-progress
The motor resides inside again!,the-motor-resides-inside-again,"<p>After work last night I got to work on the car. Eric and Russ came over to lend their assistance as well. Russ got started on the leaking wheel cylinder, Eric started putting the Intake/exhaust/turbo back onto the motor, while I worked on fabricating a bracket to mount the VR sensor onto the side of the motor.</p>  <p>While they were both productive, I actually never got my portion of the project finished last night, though I hope to finish it up tonight. Once the intake/exhaust and turbo was all back together we went ahead and began the task of putting the motor back in the car. I've got some High Definition video of that <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.project240z.com/DesktopModules/EngagePublish/itemlink.aspx?itemId=27"">process here on this Video Page</a>.</p>  <p>With Eric and Russ' help we also managed to get the drive shaft connected up and the transmission into the cross member under the tunnel. Tonight I'm going to pick up more bolts, so we can mount the fuel cell bracket to the floor of the car and then we can hookup all the fuel lines. We'll also be installing the fuel rail and injectors tonight so we can hook up the fuel lined up front.</p>  <p>At that point I hope to start trying to figure out the wiring for the car, that's the big project left for this weekend, get wiring going so we can try to start this bad boy up.</p>  <p>Here are some various photos from last night</p>  <p><a style=""text-decoration: none""

Yet another setback!,yet-another-setback,"<p>Tonight Natalie and I went and looked at a house, it's got ~5 acres, a 2 stall barn, a hay shed, and an oversized two car garage. That covers the basics. While looking around in the garage I found a circuit breaker, sweet, setup just for the garage. It's even got a section marked &quot;Welder&quot;! score, 220 already wired in the garage. Where do I sign?</p>  <p>I got home and finished dinner around 9 or 9:30pm, didn't feel much like working on the car. So, I didn't. Then I thought, well I had better check if the fittings I ordered last night would work on the oil cooler adapter. Guess what? They don't f'ng fit! I don't know who was smoking crack on the HybridZ Forums, but the oil cooler adapter plate's fittings are NOT 18mm, at least the 18mm x 1.5 to 10AN fittings I got sure are too damn big.</p>  <p>After I found that, all the stuff I had overnighted from Summit last night is pretty much useless, at least until I figure out what sizes I really need, or I just try to order another oil cooler adapter. That set me over the edge, I decided I was just going to try and take the oil filter adapter out of the block from my 78 280Z motor sitting on the floor of the garage.</p>  <p>The other night I attempted to find two nuts to fit over this to aid in backing this adapter out, I failed at finding any. So I took my vice grips and clamped down, the adapter came out rather easily. I stuck that adapter into the block on the turbo motor, and stuck the oil filter on. Problem solved, no more oil cooler, at least not for now. Though I could have saved myself a few hundred bucks had I just done that two nights ago :(</p>  <p>Later tonight I went back out to the garage (around 11:30) and started looking at how I'm going to fabricate my mount for the VR sensor to read the 36-1 wheel. I think I have a good setup figured out and will fabricate that immediately after work tomorrow so I can try to finish up any welding I may need to do (I think that's the last thing) because I know the <a href=""http://321govideo.com/rallybug/"">Rally Bug</a> will be needing the welder back soon!</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>",2007-07-19 09:14:00.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/293/Yet-another-setback
Two nights of little progress,two-nights-of-little-progress,"<p>Monday night I didn't get crap done on the project! I started to work on the oil filter/block attachment only to realize after driving around for 2 hours that I wasn't going to find any easy way to block off the oil cooler attachments for the 83 L28ET motor. By the time I got home from that it was well after 9 and I needed to spend some time with my wife.</p>  <p>Tuesday I ordered AN fittings to go from the metric 18mm x 1.5 oil cooler fittings to AN -10 fittings so that I can run steel braided lines to the new oil cooler I ordered. All of that should be here tomorrow.</p>  <p>Tuesday after work I began putting things back together on the Intake Manifold. I spent far too long digging around the garage trying to find parts I haven't seen in a few weeks. Yes, I need FAR BETTER organization in the garage. I'll probably have to spend some time Thursday or Friday night cleaning up if I'm going to have anyone over to help out this weekend. After that I headed off to <font size=""-1""><span class=""a"">Speed Sports up in Bridgeton (<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.speedsportstopfuel.com"">http://www.<strong>speed</strong><strong>sports</strong>topfuel.com</a>, store hours from 7-10pm M-F) to pick up some AN-4 steel braided line for my turbo oil feed. I got a 1/8&quot; NPT to AN-4 fitting, a 90 degree hose fitting, and the fittings I needed on the turbo side, as well as 5 feet (about 1 ft too much) of AN -4 hose. I figured out when I got home that the port on the block for the oil fitting is NOT 1/8&quot; NPT, it's actually 1/8&quot; BSPT, which is very similiar, but different enough to make my fitting not work.</span></font></p>  <p><font size=""-1""><span class=""a"">With this info, I think I've now figured out why the pipe thread plugs I had purchased a few months ago wouldn't work, I probably need BSPT for those as well. I've found a few parts online that I can order to convert from BSPT to NPT, I'll see if anyone locally has those tomorrow, otherwise I'll get those ordered tomorrow.</span></font></p>  <p><font size=""-1""><span class=""a"">After leaving Speed Sports I headed down the street to Autozone. At AZ I picked up a lot of hoses, clamps and other random bits of things I needed to reassemble the motor. I also picked up a GM open element Air Temperature sensor to thread into the Intake manifold to be able to tell what the air temp is going into the motor, I had to get the Wells part, I think SU107 was the # but I could be wrong. AZ didn't have a pigtail so I'll try Carquest tomorrow to see if they have the pigtail so I can wire this up to the megasquirt.</span></font></p>  <p><font size=""-1""><span class=""a"">When I got home I threaded the temperature sensor into the Intake manifold. I also managed to get the thermostat gasket installed into the housing, the GM Water Temperature Sensor installed into the Thermo housing, and cleaned up the snail for the turbo. It was a bit dirty from sitting in a barn for who knows how many years. I'll take pics of everything later this week.</span></font></p>  <p><font size=""-1"">After running around this evening I got to thinking about how much this project has cost me lately. Without going into specifics (because my mother will read this) I've spent more this month than I spent to purchase the car. June was the same, and possibly double what I've spent so far this month.</font></p>  <p><font size=""-1"">I know I've got a few more things I'll have to purchase, but hopefully I've got all the big items out of the way, at least for this phase of the project.</font></p>  <p><font size=""-1"">More coming this week, and I promise to start doing video again!</font></p>  <p><font size=""-1""><span class=""a""><br />  </span></font></p>",2007-07-18 09:32:53.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/294/Two-nights-of-little-progress
All in a day's paint,all-in-a-day's-paint,"<p><a target=""_blank"" href=""../../../../../Blog/tabid/53/EntryID/74/Default.aspx"">After yesterday's fun Eric and I</a> spent some time in the garage today. I was awoken this morning around 8:00am by the doorbell, the Dish Network guy showed up right on time, more on that topic tomorrow on <a href=""http://themadblogger.org/"">http://TheMadBlogger.org</a>. After I got the Dish guy going I sent Eric an SMS to let him know I was out in the garage working.</p>  <p>The first thing I need was to lay some fiberglass in the passenger floorboard. I had missed a few spots on that side earlier in the week, and layed some extra resin in the floor to smooth out the pockmarks from the cleaned up rust.&nbsp;</p>  <p>While I let that dry I pulled the extra rear end that I had in the garage so I could start cleaning it up. As soon as I saw the rear end/suspension sitting in the driveway I immediately noticed a difference from the rear suspension that is on the car currently. The current suspension doesn't have a rear sway bar, the spare does. That's fine and dandy, I'd prefer the rear sway bar, the problem though is that the fuel cell frame that I fabricated fits right where the sway bar goes on this spare suspension.</p>  <p>I'm not sure what I'll do with that aspect, but Eric and I spent the rest of the morning taking apart the spare rear suspension. We cleaned a lot of parts, figured out that the shocks (at least on the rear) are KYB's, they do look to be fairly new (or unused as that may be more correct). We got just about everything apart, and came up with plenty of parts to clean and paint (Powdercoat for Rande?)&nbsp;later in the project. Before I can use the rear swaybar I'm going to have to figure out what I'll need to change on the fuel cell bracket to make it work. I might be able to move the mounts for the bar a little higher to allow me to use the cell as currently fabricated.</p>  <p>From there Eric and I started to prep for paint the interior. We cleaned up some of the dust that had gathered, drilled some pilot holes for the seat bolts in the floor (to get to the rear brackets for the seat mounts we had to cut a whole for a socket to fit through). We brushed, vacuumed, wiped and scrubbed the interior to try to get it ready for paint. We lowered the car down off the jackstands and spent the rest of the afternoon painting the interior with a nice satin black &quot;Chassis Saver&quot; paint that I had picked up on Saturday morning.</p>  <p>I had purchased a gravity fed spray gun back in 2003 when&nbsp;I had the 350Z, previously using it once to spray some waste of money wax on the car, the gun hadn't been used since then. I think the paint this time around turned out great, an easy low cost solution that is WAY cleaner than it was prior to all this work. It was a bit laborious, but I think well worth the effort, Eric agrees.</p>  <p>Here are some before pictures</p>  <p class=""Photo""><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/409594222/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img height=""160"" alt="""" width=""240"" src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/188/409594222_9c3c5b701f_m.jpg"" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/498988300/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img height=""240"" alt="""" width=""160"" src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/217/498988300_ad19a541c5_m.jpg"" /></a> <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/782279103/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img height=""160"" alt="""" width=""240"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1191/782279103_f6dc23edc9_m.jpg"" /></a></p>  <p class=""Photo""><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/783124258/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img height=""160"" alt="""" width=""240"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1253/783124258_ae0f26041a_m.jpg"" /></a></p>  <p>And here are some after shots.</p>  <p class=""Photo""><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/824938492/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img height=""160"" alt="""" width=""240"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1189/824938492_9f563166b1_m.jpg"" /></a>&nbsp;<img height=""160"" alt="""" width=""240"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1260/824668014_2b20a5cdcd_m.jpg"" />&nbsp;<br />  <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/824056123/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img height=""160"" alt="""" width=""240"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1329/824056123_dcc0ec1cf2_m.jpg"" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/824677014/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img height=""160"" alt="""" width=""240"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1436/824677014_903f6fd289_m.jpg"" /></a></p>  <p><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/sets/72157594465585463/"">There are more photos in my Flickr set for Project240z.com</a></p>  <p>We ended up painting a few coats over most areas of the interior and then let the car sit for a while to dry. Once dry we rolled the car back into the garage and started running fuel lines. We ran both the feed and return lines for the fuel cell, mounted the pump again after removing it for paint, and fixed the fuel lines to the transmission tunnel.</p>  <p>Tomorrow I'll be working on the motor again. I hope to get the intake and exhaust manifolds back on the motor so that we can put it in the car Tuesday or Wednesday night. From there it'll be time to start wiring up the Megasquirt.</p>",2007-07-16 09:14:37.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/295/All-in-a-day's-paint
Here little birdy birdy,here-little-birdy-birdy,"<p>Well, I got absolutely nothing done on the car today. I did manage to buy a few necessary items, but work on the car was not had.</p>  <p>Instead I spent the day helping my buddy Eric. He mistakenly LOST his girlfriend's parrot last night. So today we went bird hunting all day. Finally around 7pm Kendra stepped up and showed she had a bigger pair than both Eric or I. She climbed a tree about 3-4 stories up and got the bird to come down to her.</p>  <p>A more detailed blog post will be on <a href=""http://chrishammond.com"">http://chrishammond.com </a>later this weekend.</p>",2007-07-15 08:25:28.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/296/Here-little-birdy-birdy

You can't really see it in the photos, but it's quite a clean look on the driver's side now. I can't wait to see how all this looks once painted.

Fuel Cell frame construction,fuel-cell-frame-construction,"<p>This morning I set out into the garage to tackle a fairly large task, at least in my mind. My goal was to build a frame that will secure my 15 gallon fuel cell to the Project 240Z. In case you don't want to read the rest of this post, I was successful!</p>  <p>I began with a few shots of the car before I started cutting into it (further than I cut last weekend). There are various shots here, above and below.</p>  <p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/688010251/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img height=""75"" alt=""Before"" width=""75"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1284/688010251_c5f52df804_s.jpg"" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/688014903/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img height=""75"" alt=""Before"" width=""75"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1149/688014903_30f5d0d433_s.jpg"" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/688029701/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img height=""75"" alt=""Before"" width=""75"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1251/688029701_f164521805_s.jpg"" /></a> <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/688025165/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img height=""75"" alt=""Before"" width=""75"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1116/688025165_33f872e8e8_s.jpg"" /></a> <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/688885702/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img height=""75"" alt=""Before"" width=""75"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1172/688885702_21916b9649_s.jpg"" /></a> <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/688906740/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img height=""75"" alt=""Stock Tank Location"" width=""75"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1429/688906740_35837eb263_s.jpg"" /></a>&nbsp;<a class=""image_link"" id=""set_thumb_link_688917226"" title=""Driver's Side"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/688917226/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img height=""75"" alt=""Driver's Side"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1066/688917226_1a8f198255_s.jpg"" width=""75"" /></a> <a class=""image_link"" id=""set_thumb_link_688911408"" title=""Towards the front"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/688911408/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img height=""75"" alt=""Towards the front"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1381/688911408_f17497bbef_s.jpg"" width=""75"" /></a></p>  <p>After taking those shots I got to cutting. Dave (from <a href=""http://www.soloperformance.com/""><font color=""#3399ff"">www.soloperformance.com</font></a>) and I had discussed how to mount the cell into the car on Tuesday when he came over, so I had an idea of what I wanted to do. I quickly marked some lines to cut with a sharpie, then proceeded to tear up two cutting wheels removing metal from the rear of the car. I don't know why that stock metal tears up wheels, but they sure to go away quickly when cutting on the car. Here are photos of what was left after cutting.</p>  <p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/688065565/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img height=""75"" alt=""Big ole hole"" width=""75"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1079/688065565_3cb0b3ffd7_s.jpg"" /></a> <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/688056387/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img height=""75"" alt=""2 Wheels Later"" width=""75"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1021/688056387_98b20f1e34_s.jpg"" /></a>&nbsp;<a class=""image_link"" id=""set_thumb_link_688936738"" title=""Cuts at the rear"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/688936738/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img height=""75"" alt=""Cuts at the rear"" width=""75"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1158/688936738_48089af809_s.jpg"" /></a></p>  <p>The intention for the fuel cell frame was to bolt a bar on the back of the rear differential mount, weld to 1x1&quot; square tubes parallel to the ground running towards the back of the car, then come up at a 90 degree angle from those tubes with more square steel. Those two vertical posts would weld to a bar running inside the back of the car, this bar would also be bolted into the car, not welded, so that if necessary the whole frame can be pulled out with minimal effort.</p>  <p>Here are a few pictures of the end result of the frame, as well as some of my crappy welds! I figured out with all but two welds done, that I had somehow adjusted the wirespeed on the welder in the wrong direction, and that was why I was having a horrible time.

What's next? Well like I said, tomorrow night I'll be building the driver's side seat mount, as well as visiting Mr. Whittle's house to test fit some fuel injectors into my new fuel rail that should be arriving and the old intake manifold. If the injectors he has fit I'll be ordering injectors on Tuesday.</p>  <p>After that I'll be running fuel lines, and be working on putting the motor back together so I can attempt to put it back in the car next weekend if all goes well. That might be a lofty goal, but this whole project has been lofty for me, so why quit shooting high now!</p>",2007-07-02 08:50:36.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/301/Fuel-Cell-frame-construction

With the two cross braces in place I wasn't comfortable making tabs that long and with little support, so I installed two more cross braces into the car, in front of the two existing braces.</p>  <p>These two new braces were each welded at the body, and then to the original (from earlier this week) brace in the middle, actually reusing the tabs I had recently removed to add some support in the middle. I then welded on new tabs, this time spanning both braces on each half of the seat, adding support to the tab, as well as making the tab 2&quot; wide instead of 1.5&quot; as I had originally made. This should create for better support of the seat brackets. Here are the photos of the newly created tabs and cross braces.</p>  <p><a class=""image_link"" id=""set_thumb_link_673247061"" title=""Take 2"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/673247061/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img height=""75"" alt=""Take 2"" width=""75"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1351/673247061_e1d2c9e8cf_s.jpg"" /></a><a class=""image_link"" id=""set_thumb_link_673253349"" title=""Take 2"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/673253349/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img height=""75"" alt=""Take 2"" width=""75"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1252/673253349_28177b0167_s.jpg"" /></a><a class=""image_link"" id=""set_thumb_link_673258863"" title=""Side welding"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/673258863/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img height=""75"" alt=""Side welding"" width=""75"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1058/673258863_81ab7419cf_s.jpg"" /></a><a class=""image_link"" id=""set_thumb_link_673265749"" title=""Transmission Tunnel Welds"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/673265749/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img height=""75"" alt=""Transmission Tunnel Welds"" width=""75"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1247/673265749_78fef8c31a_s.jpg"" /></a><a class=""image_link"" id=""set_thumb_link_674131972"" title=""Brace weld"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/674131972/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img height=""75"" alt=""Brace weld"" width=""75"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1025/674131972_069ae9895d_s.jpg"" /></a><br />  <a class=""image_link"" id=""set_thumb_link_674137570"" title=""New Tabs (front)"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/674137570/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img height=""75"" alt=""New Tabs (front)"" width=""75"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1409/674137570_524a72b49d_s.jpg"" /></a><a class=""image_link"" id=""set_thumb_link_674142596"" title=""New Tabs (front)"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/674142596/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img height=""75"" alt=""New Tabs (front)"" width=""75"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1332/674142596_f3811289be_s.jpg"" /></a><a class=""image_link"" id=""set_thumb_link_673285983"" title=""New Tab and Bracing )Front)"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/673285983/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img height=""75"" alt=""New Tab and Bracing )Front)"" width=""75"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1212/673285983_696e9f3987_s.jpg"" /></a><a class=""image_link"" id=""set_thumb_link_673291071"" title=""New Brackets"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/673291071/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img height=""75"" alt=""New Brackets"" width=""75"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1310/673291071_0c4bc236b5_s.jpg"" /></a><a class=""image_link"" id=""set_thumb_link_674157068"" title=""Brackets/Tabs take 2"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/674157068/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img height=""75"" alt=""Brackets/Tabs take 2"" width=""75"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1326/674157068_0c3eb83175_s.jpg"" /></a><br />  <a class=""image_link"" id=""set_thumb_link_674162016"" title=""Final Product"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/674162016/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img height=""75"" alt=""Final Product"" width=""75"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1420/674162016_80ec4dcc09_s.jpg"" /></a><a class=""image_link"" id=""set_thumb_link_673306027"" title=""Final Product"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/673306027/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img height=""75"" alt=""Final Product"" width=""75"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1040/673306027_77e7e6fb17_s.jpg"" /></a><a class=""image_link"" id=""set_thumb_link_674172500"" title=""Final Seat Bracket Result"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/674172500/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img height=""75"" alt=""Final Seat Bracket Result"" width=""75"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1182/674172500_88c8bef77a_s.jpg"" /></a></p>  <p>I position and drilled holes for the Corbeau bracket in the new tabs, visible in the latter photos above.</p>  <p>After getting all of this setup I was anxious to get the seat in the car and see how she fit. To get the seat in the car I had to mount the Corbeau bracket directly to the seat with 4 bolts that will go through the new tabs in place. I wrapped the seat in towels and put on some clean latex gloves so that I wouldn't get the fabric dirty from all my gunk.</p>  <p>In order to actually thread the nuts on the rear bolts I have to tilt the seat backward, for now this is alright, but when&nbsp;I actually go to use the seat this won't work well. What I think I'll do is get a combination of some rubber and metal washers, which I think will allow me to tighten the rear nuts down and still be able to tilt the base of the seat back a bit, once tight, lower the front of the seat into it's tabs and tighten up the bolts there. The front tabs are easy to access, the rear tabs, not so much. Anyways, here are the photos of the seat in the car.</p>  <p><a class=""image_link"" id=""set_thumb_link_673315591"" title=""Seat attached!"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/673315591/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img height=""75"" alt=""Seat attached!"" width=""75"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1028/673315591_2eed7f4631_s.jpg"" /></a><a class=""image_link"" id=""set_thumb_link_673319285"" title=""Seat attached!"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/673319285/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img height=""75"" alt=""Seat attached!"" width=""75"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1165/673319285_f60ef41a13_s.jpg"" /></a><a class=""image_link"" id=""set_thumb_link_673323819"" title=""Seat attached!"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/673323819/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img height=""75"" alt=""Seat attached!"" width=""75"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1026/673323819_1f5cc2d7b4_s.jpg"" /></a><a class=""image_link"" id=""set_thumb_link_673328497"" title=""Seat attached!"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/673328497/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img height=""75"" alt=""Seat attached!"" width=""75"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1239/673328497_9f43a1d962_s.jpg"" /></a><a class=""image_link"" id=""set_thumb_link_674193116"" title=""Seat attached!"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/674193116/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img height=""75"" alt=""Seat attached!"" width=""75"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1156/674193116_3fdba6ab68_s.jpg"" /></a><br />  <a class=""image_link"" id=""set_thumb_link_673345811"" title=""Seat In Car"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/673345811/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img height=""75"" alt=""Seat In Car"" width=""75"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1067/673345811_34e99f66c8_s.jpg"" /></a><a class=""image_link"" id=""set_thumb_link_674214938"" title=""In Car"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/674214938/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img height=""75"" alt=""In Car"" width=""75"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1219/674214938_a8994aeb78_s.jpg"" /></a>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Tomorrow I'll be installing the driver's seat, most likely in the same manner as the passenger side, I'll also be starting on mounting the fuel cell, cutting out sections of the rear floorpan, and then fabricating a frame for the cell to sit in. The ultimate goal for this 15 Gallon cell is to build&nbsp;a frame that will allow me to easily remove the fuel cell and install a smaller cell.

If at first you don't succeed,if-at-first-you-don't-succeed,"<p>So tonight didn't go to well. First off, I marked the tabs on the seat mounts for drilling, drilled the holes, (all too close to the edges IMHO) only to figure out that I had marked the holes with the corbeau bracket turned sideway, so they were all off by 90 degrees.</p>  <p>Easy enough, redrill 3 of the holes, one was even worse off than before, too close to an edge, but I figured wtf I might as well tighten them all down and mount the seat right? See some progress. Wrong. The seat won't fit. Long story short, be sure to measure everything before you go off and mount a seat!</p>  <p>I'll be cutting off the tabs and welding on new tabs tomorrow/saturday. The new ones will point forward, bringing the seat forward on the new mounts, rather than backwards, this should create the room I need. Currently it's impossible to get the rear two bolts into the seat on the bracket, partially because I can't actually slide the seat back all the way because it hits the wheel well for the rear.</p>  <p>I am glad I chose to do the passenger side first, this way I should have the process down pat for when I go to build the driver's side mounts this weekend. No pics, too pissed off tonight.</p>",2007-06-29 08:01:08.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/303/If-at-first-you-don't-succeed

Mount both seats in the car, though I'll pull them back out until I'm ready to leave them in there for a while, they are too nice to keep in such a dirty car till it gets cleaned up!

P240Z fabricating a seat bracket,p240z-fabricating-a-seat-bracket,"<p>Tonight was a semi productive night on the 240Z, which is always a good thing when some productivity happens during the week, it's hard enough being productive on the weekends. More on tonight in a bit. Summit Racing kindly sent me all of the <a href=""http://www.project240z.com/Blog/tabid/53/EntryID/63/Default.aspx"">fuel part oddities I had ordered last week</a>. I had a 12x12 box sitting at the office when I returned&nbsp;from lunch today. I was dissapointed to find such a small box, after spending so much money! But I guess I did order &quot;small&quot; parts.</p>  <p>After work I headed home and met up with Dave from <a href=""http://www.soloperformance.com/""><font color=""#2c2c2c"">http://www.soloperformance.com/</font></a> who came over tolend a hand. First we hypothesized on how to mount the 15 Gallon fuel cell I have for the car. I think we've come up with a good plan, and I hope to start fabricating that later this week. After going over that plan we started cutting and fabricating new seat mounts for the Project240z. We got quite a bit done on the Passenger side of the car. I started on that side just incase I were to screw something up, I can always drive without a passenger seat if needed, but I'll always need a driver's seat!</p>  <p><a href=""http://www.project240z.com/DesktopModules/EngagePublish/itemlink.aspx?itemId=26"">Here's a link to the Video I took tonight.</a> Towards the end you'll notice a small camera issue, the tape came loose and the camera basically inverted, which made for some kinda cool video as well.

A small victory (updated),a-small-victory-(updated),"<p>With the help of a buddy of mine I was able to get the intake manifold removed from the car, as well as the exhaust manifold and the turbo.</p>  <p>I had hoped to have video up today but for some reason my laptop apparently decided to have some troubles with the video file from today. I do have the engine removal on tape, in high def. I got a new video camera today, Natalie and I needed one (she's got a lesson with a very big name in training on Monday that she wants me to record), the camera is amazing. I hooked it up to my plasma TV and holy cow, my garage looks better on TV than in person! I'll work tomorrow to get the HD video off that camera.</p>  <p>I have a few hours of video with my normal webcam setup, hopefully this chkdsk I'm running now will repair one of the videos. Otherwise it looks like I'll only have the motor removal from the webcam, not the 2 hours of work after that removing all the intake/exhaust manifold parts.</p>  <p>What's next? Cleanup time. I'm going to be ordering a fuel rail, injectors, pressure system/guage, and look into options for cleaning up the intake manifold. I may end up trying to have some machine work done on the manifold, and have the intake/exhaust manifolds coated before I go to put them back on.</p>  <p>More on that later this week.

Long story short, I didn't get very far and I'm going to pull the motor back out of the car on Saturday. Getting parts removed off the motor is a huge pain in the rear with it in the car, so I'm just going to disconnect the driveshaft, motor mount and transmission mount and pull the thing back out for now.</p>  <p>I'll probably take this time to look at replacing the fuel rail and injectors while I have it out of the car. I need to pull it out so I can retap some of the holes I need to fill, as well as clean it out, I'm sure it has all sorts of crap in there that I'd rather not blow into the motor the first time it starts up.</p>  <p><a href=""http://www.project240z.com/tabid/54/itemid/23/240Z-Intake-Manifold-Bolts.aspx"">Here is a link to the video from this evening.</a> Nothing too interesting, but a cool camera angle.

Here's the result of what I was making, though I'm still going to drill a hole in it and tap that hole for the temperature sensor I'll be mounting in the intake manifold.</p>  <p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/543370746/""><img height=""160"" alt="""" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1239/543370746_70f8e4f746_m.jpg"" width=""240"" /></a>&nbsp;</p>  <p>I also got to use my new drill press to drill the holes in the plate, it all worked really darn well.</p>  <p>After getting the plate made I decided it was time to remove the intake manifold from the car so I could tap and fill some of the holes on the manifold that I don't need to use. I brough the webcam with me and mounted it directly above the motor on the chery picker. I started removing bolts, then decided to read the haynes, it told me I need to remove the Turbo and a few other things to get the manifold removed, I guess I should of planned things a bit better and done most of this work BEFORE I put the engine back in the car, it sure would be a lot easier to get to.</p>  <p>Once I realized how much I had to remove to get the manifold off I decided I didn't want to do all that last night, it was nearly 10pm by then. So I moved to the other side of the motor, bringing the camera with me to the other side. Andy and I decided last week to remove the attachments for the oil cooler for now, I'm going to attempt to get the car running without the cooler for now, and reinstall it down the road as I don't have all the hardware for it.</p>  <p>So I started removing it last night, got it removed, and then saw that without the attachment there isn't a way to mount the oil filter to the block. So tonight I'll be attempting to remove the oil filter attachment from the parts motor (78 l28e) to see if I can use it on the 83 L28ET.</p>  <p>After all this I decided it was time to head inside and play with the cool video I had shot last night, only to realize that I had click on the record audio button, instead of record video. So yet again, there isn't any video to be had :(</p>  <p>Tonight though I promise I'll do my best to get it right and have a video to post of the evenings work.</p>",2007-06-13 19:51:12.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/313/Fun-power-tools-and-more-240Z-progress
"P240Z update, broken Craftsmen power tools",p240z-update-broken-craftsmen-power-tools,"<p>So this weekend was anything but productive. I ended up not getting a thing done on the car this weekend. I did manage to get the drill press together Saturday morning, and I acquired a trailer Saturday morning.</p>  <p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/539691517/""><img height=""180"" alt="""" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1145/539691517_592abae1cf_m.jpg"" width=""240"" /></a>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Sunday was a different story. I had planned on getting a lot done, but ended up sleeping all day. While it was nice, it was far from what I needed to get the car going.</p>  <p>Tonight I went out with Russ and Matt Melton and Jeff &quot;The Jeweler&quot; Krekler, down to dinner in Soulard. From there I took Russ back to his house, saw his family, and came home with new motivation to get some work done on the car.</p>  <p>I changed and went outside, setup the laptop to record video and go to work. I was cutting some aluminum scrap I picked up from the Metal Supermarket last Friday. I started making a new blockoff plate for the AAC valve on the L28ET intake manifold. I cut a rough pattern out with the jigsaw, made from tracing the bottom of the AAC valve with a sharpee and an awl to cut into the aluminum. I then went to assemble my new vertical belt sander that I purchased on Friday.</p>  <p>The while taking it out of the box I noticed the darn thing was broken. Not likely broken to the point I couldn't use it, but I decided nonetheless to box it back up and take it back to Sears tomorrow to get a replacement.</p>  <p>So that was the end of work tonight, I couldn't go any further on the plate and had some work to do on a few websites. I came inside to try to work on my video I recorded, but apparently managed to hose the video recording on the laptop by unplugging the camera before shutting off the software, so there's a tip, if you're using the lifecam software don't unplug the camera before you shut down the software, you're libel to lose your video.</p>",2007-06-12 08:54:32.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/314/P240Z-update-broken-Craftsmen-power-tools

That or perhaps I cut the well out and mount it, but that might be a future project.</p>  <p><a href=""http://www.v8efi.com"">Whittle</a> came over last night and we spent 3 hours going over the car and teaching me about relays and stuff about the Megasquirt. The squirt is nearly ready to install, he's adding a jumper to the board for the MAF, but other than that I think it's ready to go into the car as soon as I have all the wires run. I ran out tonight and picked up fuses, have yet to find a good fuse block though.</p>  <p>I tried Autozone, they had something that might work but I had hoped to find something a little cleaner so I ran to Radio Shack and Walmart, neither place had any fuse blocks to use. I'll try a few more places tomorrow and see what I can locate. I really only need like 6 fuses but I bought plenty of spares. I need to fabricate something to mount the fuse block and a couple of relays too. I'm thinking some sort of black plexiglass/lexan or acryllic of some sort, though I'm not sure where to even begin looking for something like that in town, so they might just get bolted down to a piece of sheet metal for the time being.</p>  <p>So what's next? Here are my goals for this weekend.</p>  <ol>      <li>Get the fuel cell mounted and lines ran, I ordered a fuel pump from Jegs yesterday, should be tomorrow or Friday.</li>      <li>Remove the oil cooler attachments for now and screw on the filter in place of the adapter, I'll run without one for a bit, once I plan on having the car driving for more than 15-30 minutes at a time (1-3 minutes for autocross) I'll look at oil cooler options</li>      <li>Mount the VR sensor for the Megasquirt</li>      <li>Mount the radiator and get hoses that will work.</li>      <li>Get the other set of front rotors turned and put back on the car w/ new bearings.</li>  </ol>  <p>Pictures and video of this weekends work coming early next week!</p>  <p>As for what's after this weekend? Well getting all the wires for the Megasquirt run! Hopefully Nick can assist me with that next week over a few nights and we'll see if I can't get this darn car ready to run!</p>  <p>Update: I found a source for Plexiglass and ordered a few square feet, some black and some smoked!</p>",2007-06-07 10:00:07.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/317/Fuel-cell-arrived-list-of-things-to-get-done

Heat gun on a hot night,heat-gun-on-a-hot-night,"<p>Tonight after work <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/ejmack "">Eric</a> and I headed to Creve Couer park to do some skating. Kendra met us there to bring Eric socks and skated with us as well. As a group we went around the park once, they called it a night&nbsp;after that lap but I decided I'd go around one more lap before heading home. I had a big lunch so I figured I could definitely use the exercise.</p>  <p>After that I came home and recovered for a few minutes. I had said I'd do some work on the 240z though so I felt i must get something done. I went out into the garage and grabbed 4 things. A pair of latex gloves, a shop light, a paint scraper and my heat gun. I went to work on the interior of the car and got most of the remaining tar board out of the floorboard of the driver and passenger sides. That should allow me to do a little prep work later this week and then get to painting the interior to clean it up.</p>  <p>I'll take some pics and video as I start doing more work inside the car.

Cutting up the JPipe,cutting-up-the-jpipe,"<p>I got some work done on the car, I think I figured out one of the biggest holdups I've had.</p>  <p>The JPipe on my motor (the pipe from the Turbo to the Throttlebody) was mangled pretty bad, so much it wouldn't get a good seal on the throttlebody. Last night I cut about 4 inches out of it and bashed it with a rubber mallet for a while. I think I managed to get it where it will get a seat on the throttle body and still connect to the turbo. At least, hopefully a good enough seal the motor will run, after it runs the pipe will be tossed as it'll get replaced with an intercooler.</p>  <p>After playing with the pipe for a while I finally got around to removing the wastegate cover, tonight I'll test fit the downpipe onto the turbo. Here are some photos from last night.</p>  <p><a style=""text-decoration: none"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/511680556/in/pool-341731@N21""><img height=""75"" alt=""Turbo to Throttle Body"" border=""0"" src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/221/511680556_c649864acc_m.jpg"" /> </a><a style=""text-decoration: none"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/511708451/in/pool-341731@N21""><img height=""75"" alt=""Throttle Body"" border=""0"" src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/229/511708451_78d3f96434_m.jpg"" /> </a><a style=""text-decoration: none"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/511682036/in/pool-341731@N21""><img height=""75"" alt=""take my photo I dare u"" border=""0"" src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/222/511682036_db0f403f6c_m.jpg"" /> </a><a style=""text-decoration: none"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/511709595/in/pool-341731@N21""><img height=""75"" alt=""My crooked back"" border=""0"" src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/229/511709595_b07e5ace6a_m.jpg"" /> </a><a style=""text-decoration: none"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/511683454/in/pool-341731@N21""><img height=""75"" alt=""Waste Gate Housing"" border=""0"" src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/197/511683454_f833b66842_m.jpg"" /> </a><a style=""text-decoration: none"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/511684156/in/pool-341731@N21""><img height=""75"" alt=""Waste Gate Housing"" border=""0"" src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/217/511684156_4fd127c770_m.jpg"" /> </a><a style=""text-decoration: none"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/511711777/in/pool-341731@N21""><img height=""75"" alt=""Waste Gate Housing"" border=""0"" src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/225/511711777_41c134103c_m.jpg"" /> </a><a style=""text-decoration: none"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/511712479/in/pool-341731@N21""><img height=""75"" alt=""Turbo"" border=""0"" src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/229/511712479_b7e7c4c596_m.jpg"" /> </a><a style=""text-decoration: none"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/511686158/in/pool-341731@N21""><img height=""75"" alt=""Turbo"" border=""0"" src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/220/511686158_4201a02c4f_m.jpg"" /></a></p>",2007-05-24 17:20:07.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/321/Cutting-up-the-JPipe

A Project Epiphany,a-project-epiphany,"<p>Last night I spent a few hours sitting in the car. I had decided over the weekend I needed to take out all of the interior, or at least most of it, and clean up the inside of the car. I can always get the outside painted later, but the inside, if I'm going to be in it, needs to be cleaned up, and painted. It's orange, or red, I can't tell which, and though most of the interior items cover the orange there are gaps that show through.</p>  <p>So I took out all the diamond plate looking black vinyl, and then started removing the tar board and furry coating over the transmission tunnel. I've removed all that I think I can remove right now, and eventually will also pull the dash out and replace the dash with a fiberglass dash I acquired when I purchased the car.</p>  <p>While sitting in the car I had a lot of time to think, and based on the state of the car (old, rusty, partially assembled) I have decided that I won't be building the car up to SM2 rules anymore. I'll be aiming for the new XP class in SCCA Solo. By going to XP, I no longer have to worry about a few major things that I was concerned with.</p>  <p>I don't have to deal with the interior anymore, I can do whatever I want (I think), so I can do something custom inside, without having to worry about SM2 rules about interiors. Moving to XP also frees up my options with mounting my seat. With SM2 mounting my seat like I plan to mount it may not have been legal, it'd have been a grey area, but within the rules of XP I believe I'll have all sorts of options for mounting the seat and remaining in the rules.</p>  <p>So, XP here I come. I still plan to compete in SM2 for St. Louis region autocrosses this year, at least 4 more in SM2, then I'll try to run the 240Z in XP, unless of course I just talk myself into running XP for enough events to qualify for a year end class championship.</p>  <p>Photos of the interior after last night's work.</p>  <div class=""PoolList"" id=""pool_499038551""><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/499038551/in/pool-240z/""><img height=""67"" alt="""" src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/222/499038551_0664df6a27_t.jpg"" width=""100"" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/498991348/in/pool-240z/""><img height=""67"" alt="""" src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/203/498991348_302b50eb61_t.jpg"" width=""100"" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/498989758/in/pool-240z/""><img height=""67"" alt="""" src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/224/498989758_874270380e_t.jpg"" width=""100"" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/499037003/in/pool-240z/""><img height=""67"" alt="""" src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/226/499037003_b99ae80d1b_t.jpg"" width=""100"" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/499035671/in/pool-240z/""><img height=""100"" alt="""" src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/219/499035671_8a91b9158a_t.jpg"" width=""67"" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/498988300/in/pool-240z/""><img height=""100"" alt="""" src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/217/498988300_ad19a541c5_t.jpg"" width=""67"" /></a></div>",2007-05-15 16:23:46.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/324/A-Project-Epiphany

Mark stops by with a welder,mark-stops-by-with-a-welder,"<P>Some of you have kept up with my blog posts, first <A href=""http://www.izzyscustomcages.com/"">Scott</a> got on me about using <A href=""/Blog/tabid/53/EntryID/30/Default.aspx"">Bondo on the Project 240z</a>, so he said to have someone come over and weld on the car instead of using bondo. So I started looking for a welder, might as well do it myself right? Well I didn't have much luck in the price range I was looking for. I had originally ordered something from Harbor Freight, but they suck and I cancelled the order because it ended up being on backorder.</P>  <P>Mark Huebbe from <a href=""http://www.321govideo.com"">321GoVideo.com</a> offered to let me borrow his welder for a week as he isn't going to need it this coming weekend due to the Rallycross event.</P>  <P>I jumped on the offer and he brought the welder over this evening. He took the time to give me some quick lessons, of which I was in dire need. Thanks for all your help Mark, and most of all thanks for the use of the welder! Everyone should be sure to stop by Mark's build site as he puts together his <A href=""http://www.321govideo.com/rallybug"">Rally Bug!</a></P>  <P><a href=""/tabid/54/itemid/19/Project-240Z-Rally-Bug-Welder-Arrives.aspx"">Now for Tonight's Video!

"Gas Tank update, seat fitting this weekend, harbor freight sucks",gas-tank-update-seat-fitting-this-weekend-harbor,"<P>I ended up not getting another gas tank this past weekend. I had planned on picking one up in Hillsboro but the guy ended up sounding way too sketchy for me. First the tank was perfect, then it had two holes he was going to repair, then there was a gash that needed repair, then, and then, and then. So I ended up deciding not to go get the tank. Back to looking for a Fuel Cell again, unless anyone has a source on a complete, leak free, 240Z Gas tank?</P>  <P>I'm picking up a seat from <A href=""http://www.soloperformance.com"">www.soloperformance.com</A> tomorrow to do some test fitting this weekend. I'll probably go with a Corbeau A4, but need to make sure it will fit in the car, and of course with me in it, before I order anything. I'm thinkin the black microsuede sure would look nice!</P>  <P>This section of the post should be one for <a href=""http://themadblogger.org/"">The Mad Blogger</a>, but I'll post it here anyways. Harbor Freight sucks. I ordered a welder from them last week, called today and found out it was on backorder with no expected date of arrival. I'll call them tomorrow, and if it's still not expected soon I'll cancel the order and figure something else out.... Anyone want to come over and weld some things this weekend, bring a welder!!!! </P>",2007-04-25 09:01:28.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/333/Gas-Tank-update-seat-fitting-this-weekend-harbor
Brakes bled,brakes-bled,"<P>Dad and I spent a few hours this evening working on the brakes on the 240Z. You have to be able to stop before you even start on the motor right? That's what I keep telling myself, though they brakes still need a lot of work! We did get the new (rebuilt) master cylinder installed, and bled, and apply braking force on the discs/drums!</P>  <P>We ended up with a hodgepodge of brake/clutch systems. The vacuum boost is from the 73 240z, the master cylinder is a rebuilt cylinder for a 78 280Z, the clutch is from a 78 280z as the 73 240z was originaly an auto.</P>  <P>Catch all that? Both systems are bled and semi ready. The brakes need to be pulled off the car, probably get the discs turned next week, and see what I need to do with the rear drums/shoes. Eventually I'd like to go to a 4 wheel disc setup, but that will have to wait until I have the cash to do a full suspension setup, most likely a setup from <A href=""http://www.arizonazcar.com"">www.arizonazcar.com</A>.</P>  <P>Not much else accomplished on the car tonight, hoping to get the garage a bit organized on Thursday and start shooting video again, it's been too long since I did a time lapse.</P>",2007-04-25 08:56:23.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/334/Brakes-bled
P240z Time to start again,p240z-time-to-start-again,"<P>Tonight I begin working on the 240Z again. It's been quite a while since I've worked on it, 3 weeks or so, due to work and school and of course, Opening Day at Fenway.</P>  <P>Tonight I'll be bench bleeding the rebuilt brake master cylinder that I picked up back towards the end of the month, then i plan to install the MC and bleed the brake system with the help of my father. After that I'm going to work on the interior of the car a bit more, cleaning up the rust and painting over the clean metal with hopes to prevent more rust.</P>  <P>Thursday I'll be doing more, hopefully getting to the point where I can install the pulley that <A href=""http://www.tuxedoparkracing.com"">Tuxedo Park Racing</A> is currently working on. The pully has a 36-1 trigger wheel on it for the Megasquirt Ford EDIS setup. Once I have the pulley on I'm going to start fabricating the bracket to mount the VR sensor, and hopefully get some wires run this weekend.</P>  <P>I was hoping to do some welding, but it looks like Harbor Freight has the welder I ordered on backorder. It sure as nice of them to tell me that when I ordered. I had to call and listen to the automated system just to find that out. If they don't come up with one tomorrow I'm cancelling my order and I'll look elsewhere for a welder, or get someone to do some welding for me. Russ has a welder he thinks might work, so I'll try to drag him over if I can.</P>  <P>More tonight after some work is accomplished.</P>",2007-04-24 22:22:44.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/335/P240z-Time-to-start-again

It's cheap, but will hopefully at least get me started. I can see how well I can learn, and hopefully repair/build a few things along the way. If I start to use it much (I don't foresee this) I'll look at getting a nicer model sometime.</P>  <P>I started putting my&nbsp;new workbench together last night. I'll take some pics of it once it's finished (must install the&nbsp;tabletop still)&nbsp;and moved around in the garage.

Fuel Cell time,fuel-cell-time,"<P>I took the gas tank out of the 240Z down to Manchester Radiator on Wednesday. They called me on Thursday to tell me that the tank was in a sad state. They dipped it and cleaned it up to find a lot of pinholes and larger holes in the bottom of the tank from rust. Rather than repair it they asked me if I could get another one from somewhere.</P>  <P>Lucky for me SM2 allows for Fuel Cells, now I just need to read up on the rules and figure out where I can mount one legally in my car, and figure out how much that is going to end up costing me.</P>  <P>The car hasn't been touched since last Sunday, and won't see any action before at least Thursday as Natalie and I are headed to Boston tomorrow for Opening Day on Tuesday.</P>",2007-04-07 08:43:17.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/337/Fuel-Cell-time

Bondo cleanup and Gas tank removal,bondo-cleanup-and-gas-tank-removal,"<P>I sanded the area that I bondo'd yesterday on the 240Z. I also then cleaned and sprayed it with primer.

"End of March, 15 days left",end-of-march-15-days-left,"<P>So Dad and&nbsp;I have been working on the car pretty much all day, and last night as well.</P>  <P>Last night we got a clutch line assembled and installed into the car, along with bleeding the system. We tried to get the rebuilt brake MC installed but we were unable to properly bench bleed it. Today I called Carquest and they've ordered another one which should be here Tuesday.</P>  <P>Today we did a few things. We dropped off the Pulley and 36-1 wheel for the EDIS system at Tuxedo Park Racing. Steven is going to get the wheel mounted to the pulley. We also ran around getting other parts. We got some aluminum to fabricate blockoff plates for the various items we'll be removing from the motor, distributor, EGR valve, etc. &nbsp;</P>  <P>We removed the Air Inlet Pipe, running from the Turbo to the Throttle Body as the grommet there looked to be torn. Removing it we found that to be the case, as well as that it appears to <A href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/441542048/"" target=_blank>not be formed properly</A>, possibly abused by a previous owner.</P>  <P>I took the angle grinder to the car as well <A href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/441539805/"" target=_blank>removing from rust from in front of the rear driver's side wheel.</A>&nbsp;I then, for the first time in my life, applied Bondo to try to cover some of the holes left behind by the rust. I'm going to sand it down tomorrow and try to spray it with primer to to keep some of the rust from forming again.</P>  <P>Dad ran new fuel lines for most of the rubber lines. We also bought some hardware to fabricate the throttle controls as the linkage from the parts car and this car don't quite match up together.</P>  <P>Tomorrow I'm going to work on the floors and see what I rust I can remove and cover them up with a fresh coat of paint.&nbsp;More photos posted on the Photos page!</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>",2007-04-01 08:50:08.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/340/End-of-March-15-days-left
P240Z Pulleys a pullin,p240z-pulleys-a-pullin,"<P>Well we overcame the the brake booster issues from last night. Dad got the Brakeline hooked up to the MC, and we got the booster installed in the firewall and hooked up to the pedal.</P>  <P>After that I got the proper tool and pulled the pulleys off the 78 motor and the 83 motor as well. Not likely to get any work done tomorrow as I have a meeting tomorrow night, but Dad took the radiator from the 78 to get it cleaned up and pressure checked at a shop tomorrow sometime.</P>  <P>At lunch I'll also hopefully be getting the 37pin plug for the Megasquirt put together.</P>",2007-03-29 08:48:54.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/341/P240Z-Pulleys-a-pullin
Another night of wrenching on the car,another-night-of-wrenching-on-the-car,"<P>Dad and I spent a few hours working on the 240z this evening. We got the clutch pedal in, and even got as far as putting the Clutch Master Cylinder in the car. We went to put the 78 280Z brake booster in the 73 240Z, but ended up figuring out that the firewalls on the two cars are different, and the booster out of the 78 won't fit in the 73 with a clutch installed. Sooooo, now we're trying to verify that we can use the recently purchased rebuilt brake master cylinder for the 78 booster, on the 73 booster, without any issue. We'll see how that goes! </P>  <P>After work today I ran to Illinois again to hit the Speedway salvage yard up for more parts as well. I picked up 3 wiring harnesses for the fuel injectors for the L28 motors. 1 set was off my old parts car, another off a 78 coupe that was there and another set off an 82 I believe. I'm hoping with all those connectors I can come up with at least 6 that are good enough to use to start the car up.</P>  <P>After the junkyard I hit up Carquest to pickup the rebuilt master cylinder, it was actually just about the same price as a rebuild kit, so buying the already built one made too much sense.</P>  <P>Hopefully tomorrow we can get that rest of the brake and clutch items squared away. I'm also making an electronics run tomorrow to get bits and pieces of items necessary for the megasquirt install that I hope to tackle this weekend. </P>",2007-03-28 10:18:26.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/342/Another-night-of-wrenching-on-the-car
The motor is in the Project 240z!,the-motor-is-in-the-project-240z,"<P>Look out&nbsp;Jeffs, the motor is in the Project 240z! Dad and I spent all day today working on the car, and I even swung by one of Jeef's old employer's to pickup some parts today as well.</P>  <P>Dad spent most of the morning working on the clutch master cylinder and brake master cylinder, cleaning them up quite a bit, and using a rebuild kit on the clutch MC. The brake MC has some corrosion inside, so I'll be ordering a rebuilt MC tomorrow that I should be able to pickup tomorrow night. </P>  <P>I spent the morning taking parts off of the 78 motor, cleaning them and putting them onto the 83 motor. Over the afternoon and early evening Dad and I managed to seperate the 5spd transmission from the 78 motor and put it onto the 83 motor. From the looks of things the 83 motor was either once powering an automatic tranny, or was prepped to perform that work as we had to replace the driveplate with the flywheel/pressure plate from the 78 motor as well.</P>  <P>After getting the transmission together and putting some of the parts I scavanged from the 78 motor Dad and I managed to get the motor into the Project 240z. I must say, removing motors is far easier than actually putting them back in the car. We put bolts into the motor mounts, and also into the crossmember underneath the transmission to hold it all in place, but have yet to tighten anything down just yet. </P>  <P>The megasquirt equipment should be here soon, hopefully.

Junk Yard Saturday,junk-yard-saturday,"<P>Today, well yesterday now, it's 1am, Dad and I went to Speedway salvage over in Madison Illinois. 3-4 hours later we walked out of there with $120 worth of parts for the Project 240Z. I didn't realize you could spend that much on junk?</P>  <P>I got most of the ignition system I needed to complete the Megasquirt setup, some interior plastics I needed, as well as&nbsp;the steering wheel off my parts car that I dropped off at Speedway two weeks ago. I think they even charged me for the wheel.</P>  <P>Dad took apart the brake master cylinder and start cleaning it, we'll do the same with the clutch cylinder tomorrow, and reassemble that with the rebuild kit I picked up this evening. I couldn't find a brake mc kit in town tonight, so that will have to be a future product. I also picked up 7 feet of hydrolic line to run a new clutch line and repair a brake line I had to cut last week.</P>  <P>Tomorrow (Today)&nbsp;we'll see how far we can get towards putting the 83 motor into the car. I'm going to be working on getting the parts we need off&nbsp;of the motor from the parts car so we can&nbsp;get the motor setup to drop in the car.</P>  <P>More tomorrow&nbsp;</P>",2007-03-25 10:05:27.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/344/Junk-Yard-Saturday

"240Z, the Journey home",240z-the-journey-home,"<P>So this morning I got up and finished up what I could get done on the project car, a 1978 280Z 2+2, courtesy of our very own Lynn Wilson, Thanks Lynn!!!</P>  <P>I had planned to remove the diff from the car this morning, along with the door lock from the passenger door, ignition switches and such as well. I got the switches and locks, but had a hell of a time trying to get the diff out. I got everything disconnected except the axles, without any luck getting the axles removed I gave up, hastily slapped some bolts/nuts back on the diff to hold it in place and I took some wire to tie up the driveshaft to keep it from hanging down to the floor.</P>  <P>After clearing off the parts I knew I wanted I had to run&nbsp;down to SoloPerformance to drop off the Engine Hoist that I've had for, oh almost the past year. Dave needed it for a week or so, and all I've been doing with it is using it as a nice engine hanger lately. After that quick trip I grabbed Natalie, hopped in the Tahoe and headed up North. Went to the <A href=""http://www.shimmysideways.com"" target=_blank>Elterman's</A> to pickup his trailer so I could haul cars to Egypt and back.</P>  <P>From there we headed back home, loaded up the parts car and took off to Speedway (junk yard) in Illinois. They were pretty lax about things, which was nice, I rolled the car off the trailer and headed over to the super secret storage facility. From there we filled up the flat spare tire and rolled it out of the shop and onto the trailer for the trip back home.</P>  <P>Both towing trips were uneventful, which was nice, though each car did shift around on the trailer a bit. The Tahoe towed fine, which is great! Though, I still want to see about getting a gooseneck trailer at somepoint to tow with the F350. On the way home from the super secret storage facility I decided to stop and double check the straps, just to make sure&nbsp;I wasn't going to lose my baby. I stopped out in front of this great sign ;)</P>  <P><A href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/418362758/"" target=_blank><IMG height=180 alt="""" src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/163/418362758_05c140ca13_m.jpg"" width=240 border=0></A>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>After getting home, Natalie and I unloaded the 240 from the trailer, though, not before I took the time to sweap the 5lbs of rust that the parts car had deposited on the floor of the garage.</P>  <P>After rolling her into the garage and test fitting a few of the interior pieces we headed back up north to drop James' trailer off. They weren't home, lucky for them. Had he been home he might have had a heart attack watching me back the trailer in, I ended up parking it about 6 inches from the front of the STi, that darn slopped trailer, makes it hard to judge distances. Lucky for me&nbsp;I stopped when I did, otherwise I would have felt like a complete ass for borrowing a trailer and then hitting the owners car when returning it.</P>  <P>More on the Project240z car later this week!</P>",2007-03-12 05:11:11.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/349/240Z-the-Journey-home

Notice the flannel pants, and sweatshirt. I really didn't want to do any work today, but I forced myself to at least do a little.</p>  <p>After doing that little work I started trying to figure out how I can get rid of the parts car. I drove over to Hall Street, and found no one over there to take it. So I headed to Illinois and Speedway said they would take it. So next weekend it's making a trip to Illinois for it's final resting place.</p>  <p>After that I headed to Sauget to do some inventory on the 240Z, and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised! I had forgotten how much of the stock interior actually remained in the car. I was very happy to find that the headliner, center console, dash, and some of the tunnel interior still there, which makes my life a WHOLE lot easier to get it legal for SM2 in SCCA Autocross. So I only have to order a few things, rather than a complete interior which I was having trouble finding!</p>  <p>More work tomorrow, I need to finish up the 280Z tomorrow as I'm going to be on the East Coast all of next week.</p>",2007-03-04 08:16:23.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/353/Good-news-on-the-Project-front

"Little progress, little time!",little-progress-little-time,"<p>So my weekend of working on the 240Z started off quite slowly today. I ended up sleeping until almost noon this morning, it was nice to catch up on some much lost rest from the travelling the past few months.</p>  <p>So after my restful morning I had a few errands to run to get my costume ready for a party tonight. Once those were completed I was able to spend some time in the garage. First things first getting the months of piled on crap off the top of the car. That led me to assembling the 2nd craftsman stool that I had purchased probably 10 months ago now, it was in a box on the hood of the car.</p>  <p>Once I could see the top of the car I made room at the back and rolled her back a bit in the garage, this allowed me to get to the motor which has been on the stand for quite some time sitting in front of the car. Without the Corvette in the garage (*sheds a small tear*) I had plenty of room to move the motor over to the free side of the garage to work on. The next step for the car is to get all of the motor bits back together, the manifolds, turbo and all other accessories need to be put on the car so that I can put it back in the engine bay. I spent some time this afternoon cleaning off some more of the grease/dirt that covers the motor. I think Lynn, the previous owner, took it to a rally cross based on all the dirt and grime I’ve pulled off this motor over time.</p>  <p>I didn’t get too far today, but I hope that tomorrow I can get all of the parts back on the motor, if I can successfully do that I should be able to get the motor back in the car next weekend. The biggest problem I have working on the car is staying focused, if I’m by myself I tend to stray from the task at hand, and I never seem to get anything done. Case in point today, at some point while working on clearing off the car I got out the angle grinder and wire wheeled the hole where the FM antenna was at one point, I thought it looked like it might be rusting so I took the paint off then sprayed some primer on the car. Now it looks worse than before, but I had fun! :)</p>  <p>More updates tomorrow, hopefully with some video. I tried using the Chase Cam today to shoot some video but apparently the PDR doesn’t really care for normal AA batteries as it only stayed powered on for about 5 minutes before shutting off, without me knowing.</p>",2008-10-25 19:24:26.000,html,,,/Video/itemId/399/Little-progress-little-time
"A slow Sunday, more cleaning on the motor.",a-slow-sunday-more-cleaning-on-the-motor,"<p>So I woke up this morning, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.project240z.com/Home/itemId/399/Little-progress-little-time.aspx"">earlier than yesterday</a>, but still not as early as one would have liked. First things first I ran to Radio Shack to get an AC power source for my <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.chasecam.com/"">Chase Cam</a> so that I could use it to record video today.</p>  <p>I then started working around the garage, I didn’t shoot too much video today because I wasn’t doing too much interesting when I wasn’t working on the motor. I took the oil pan off to make sure I drained any water from the block due to my impromptu cleaning yesterday. I also put two items on the motor, the thermo stat and one of the inlet/outlets for the coolant. I would have done more but I ran into a problem today.</p>  <p>I can’t seem to locate the baggy of all the manifold parts from when I removed the intake/exhaust from the other motor. I found pretty much every other part I could need for the motor except for this bag. I spent much of the day tearing through things trying to locate the bag, I’ll have to keep looking this week to find the missing parts so I can get to the assembly next weekend.</p>  <p>Now for the video.</p>  <div class=""wlWriterEditableSmartContent"" id=""scid:5737277B-5D6D-4f48-ABFC-DD9C333F4C5D:7e113c9b-afd2-4e18-adb1-d41a82e0a4e1"" style=""padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; float: none; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"">  <div id=""2f1b4df3-83b6-4a06-908a-158f9875a2e0"" style=""padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"">  <div><a target=""_new"" href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k480f-hsqgs""><img alt="""" galleryimg=""no"" onload=""var downlevelDiv = document.getElementById('2f1b4df3-83b6-4a06-908a-158f9875a2e0'); downlevelDiv.innerHTML = &quot;&lt;div&gt;&lt;object width=\&quot;425\&quot; height=\&quot;355\&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=\&quot;movie\&quot; value=\&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/k480f-hsqgs&amp;hl=en\&quot;&gt;&lt;\/param&gt;&lt;embed src=\&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/k480f-hsqgs&amp;hl=en\&quot; type=\&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash\&quot; width=\&quot;425\&quot; height=\&quot;355\&quot;&gt;&lt;\/embed&gt;&lt;\/object&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&quot;;"" style=""border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-bottom-style: none"" src=""http://www.project240z.com/Portals/0/PublishThumbnails/WindowsLiveWriter/AslowSundaymorecleaningonthemotor_11585/video621876c8e119.jpg"" /></a></div>  </div>  </div>",2008-10-26 20:44:15.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/400/A-slow-Sunday-more-cleaning-on-the-motor

It's for sale again,it's-for-sale-again,"<p>So this time, I think, I am serious about selling the Datsun. With moving sometime in the next 5-6 months I need to start preparing for the move, and with my work/school/book schedule there is no way I will have time to work on the Datsun in the coming months.</p>  <p>I'll post up more info later this week on the sale of the car, but if you're interested let me know. As of right now I will likely have everything I own for the car (minus the Corbeau A4 seats) for sale as a package.</p>  <p>1973 Datsun 240Z</p>  <p>L28E motor<br />  Megasquirt<br />  2 transmissions<br />  LOTS&#160;of other stuff including a spare suspension, hatch, and lots of boxes with parts.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>I will try to do a full inventory, or at least a more detailed inventory later on.</p>  ",2009-01-21 03:54:20.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/403/It's-for-sale-again

Well guess what I just found today!</p>  <p>Now, I just need to get my book done, and hire my good buddy Terec for a weekend to help me get the motor back together and in the car. I find that if someone is here helping me on the car I get 10x the amount of work done as if I am by myself. So, Terec, what do you think, first or second weekend in March good? If we got it running on 3/15 that would be awesome, as that’s my bday :D</p>  <p>Happy Belated Bday to Terec as well, 2/18.</p>  <p>So, am I selling the car? I don’t know.

Final Prep for Engine Installation,final-prep-for-engine-installation,"<p>So I had hoped to get the engine installed into the car today but got sidetracked trying to get a final few items finished up before doing so.</p>  <p>First things first I wanted to try and get some of the new bushings I purchased off Ebay back in December into the car, so I attempted to get the old bushings out of the rear motor mount, not having much luck I went to Carquest. They also didn’t have any luck but sent me on to Terry’s Machine Shop in Bridgeton. 25 minutes or so later (which was 20 minutes after they closed) the old bushings were free and room for the new urethane bushings available. I then ran back to Carquest and picked up some lithium grease and headed home.</p>  <p>I painted the rear motor mount one last time, as playing around with the bushings had removed some paint, and then I started on other items. I changed the bushing in the steering coupler to use the new urethane bushing, I also spent some time cleaning up some of the dust, and crap in the engine back from 2yrs ago when the car last ran. After doing this I drained the transmission and checked to see if I had any fluid to put back in it before installing it in the car tomorrow, I didn’t so I picked some up tonight.</p>  <p>I assembled the new bushings in the rear mount and then test fitted it under the car to make sure it would work, success, so hopefully it goes in smoothly tomorrow.</p>  <p>So I didn’t get a whole lot of progress made today, but I hope to tomorrow as Terec will be coming over in the morning and helping me with the big task, getting the motor up and into the car, 6 bolts should be all it takes! Then it’ll probably take me all week to hook up all the wires and lines to it, hopefully I’ll be able to try and crank it over next week.</p>  <p>Here’s the video from today, not much</p>  <p>[YouTube:L96tsQ4J5QI]</p>",2009-04-19 01:40:36.000,html,,,/Video/itemId/414/Final-Prep-for-Engine-Installation
Ahhhh the engine is in place again!,ahhhh-the-engine-is-in-place-again,"<p>A HUGE thanks to Terec for coming over today and helping me with the car. We spent a couple hours this morning and were able to get the engine and transmission into the car, it all worked out pretty well with the only hitch being that all the transmission fluid I put in, came back out :D</p>  <p>After that we hooked up the drive shaft, clutch line, and the speedo cable (which last time the car ran didn’t work anyways). We took a break to go get a rental car for my trip to Indianapolis in the morning. After returning home I drained the fuel cell of the gas that unfortunately has been in there since August 2007 when the car last ran. I barely had enough gas cans to drain it fully, though I did have to put some of the cans into the rental car… I figured out how to safely burn off old fuel though :D</p>  <p>Here are some pictures</p>  <p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/3457414214/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img alt=""Engine installed!"" width=""75"" height=""75"" src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3513/3457414214_1b4bcfeb92_s.jpg"" /></a>&#160;<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/3456593535/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img alt=""Engine installed!"" width=""75"" height=""75"" src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3567/3456593535_469212999b_s.jpg"" /></a>&#160;<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/3456591593/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img alt=""Read Engine mount"" width=""75"" height=""75"" src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3663/3456591593_99c139e7f2_s.jpg"" /></a>&#160;<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/3457408426/in/set-72157594465585463/""><img alt=""Urethant Steering Coupler "" width=""75"" height=""75"" src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3497/3457408426_fd3e737562_s.jpg"" /></a></p>  <p>and of course the video!</p>  <p>[YouTube:vQ0aHUM22vY]</p>",2009-04-19 18:28:16.000,html,,,/Video/itemId/415/Ahhhh-the-engine-is-in-place-again
Working on the 240Z on a weeknight?,working-on-the-240z-on-a-weeknight?,"<p>I can’t say I’ve really put any effort into the Datsun on a weeknight in probably the past 20-22 months, tonight I spent a couple of hours in the garage working on a few things to get the motor ready to attempt to start it this weekend. I didn’t get a lot done, but the things I did will save the time I would have had to spend on Saturday doing them. I’ve mostly got the fan in place now, with 4 more bolts to put it onto the clutch. I put the single belt in place, and also hooked up the EDIS trigger on the 36-1 wheel for the megasquirt setup.</p>  <p>I also put the throttlebody and the intake to the turbo back on the car. I put the battery onto the charger so that it’ll be ready to go Saturday. The more I mess with that thing the more I realize I need to get that moved to the back of the car soon after the car runs again, rather than having it sitting up in the engine bay taking up valuable room.</p>  <p>I’ll probably do a few more of these minor buttoning up items tomorrow and Thursday night, leaving for tasks like the radiator and coolant, along with other minor things, for Saturday when Dave and possibly Terec are over to assist.</p>  <p>[YouTube:2Ke7FK0CLHg]</p>",2009-04-22 00:07:16.000,html,,,/Video/itemId/416/Working-on-the-240Z-on-a-weeknight?

Updates from the weekend,updates-from-the-weekend,"<p>So I spoke with my Megasquirt Guru last week a few times, and again this weekend, and even had him show up in my driveway to help wrench on the car today! </p>  <p>So yesterday I got up and checked to see if the 36-1 wheel for the Megasquirt (using Ford EDIS) was correctly mounted, meaning, should the mounting have changed due to moving from the 1983 motor, to the 1978 motor. I removed the radiator in order to get to the front of the motor, draining it out was probably a good idea. We had put water in last weekend when getting things ready to start, well the water was pretty darn rusty and dirty when I took it out yesterday, probably need to do that a few more times just to make sure everything gets flushed from the radiator (sitting for 2 years) and the block, which has been sitting for 6 or more years (2+ since it last ran, longer since it actually was used much). </p>  <p>After getting the radiator out of the way I was able to confirm that TDC on the 78 motor is the same as the 83 motor, which makes things easier, I don’t have to have the pulley and 36-1 wheel modified, but it didn’t get me any closer to figuring out why I can’t get the car started.</p>  <p>I ended up bring in the Megasquirt inside so I could hook it up to my Stim and the laptop to figure out if I could see why I was getting a weird RPM signal from it when the computer was hooked up. I wasn’t able to do much there either, but Andy Whittle told me to bring the squirt and the Laptop over to his house on Sunday and he would help me out. Natalie and I went to the gun range, and afterward I had a voicemail from Andy, he was on the way up to my house, talk about service! Andy and I spent a few hours in the garage working on things. </p>  <p>We ended up figuring out that the squirt/stim worked fine on his laptop, which meant that it was a software or hardware issue on my laptop, not the megasquirt. From there he adjusted the fuel map quite a bit, we seemed to be flooding the motor so we dropped a lot of fuel, took all the plugs out and cranked it, trying to get fuel out if it was truly flooded, not much came out.</p>  <p>All in all we weren’t too successful, but we did get it to almost fire up a few times. A few times we got some nice big backfires, once enough that pressure came up through one of the cutouts in the driver’s side floorboard, enough to make my foot jump off the floor. I ended up removing the VR sensor from the 36-1 wheel at Andy’s suggestion and installed a new one, though the plug is backwards on it, so later this week I’ll try it out again, as well as try rewiring the sensor. These sensors are very picky, so we’re not sure if that’s the problem, or something else, but hopefully rewiring it will correct it and the car will start up! Hopefully right? :D </p>  <p>Huge thanks to Whittle for the help today.</p>",2009-05-04 00:15:41.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/418/Updates-from-the-weekend
It runs again!,it-runs-again,"<p>So today we had a garage sale, nothing that resides in the garage was actually sold, but we did sell a lot of stuff that we wanted to get rid of before the move.

Here's the timeline, without times.</p>  <p>Attempt to start the car as is, no dice, turns over but won't fire.</p>  <p>Remove the VR sensor, rewire it the opposite way.

Another night with not much success!,another-night-with-not-much-success,"<p> So tonight I came home from work and decided it was time to work on the Datsun a bit, after over a week of barely even looking at it when walking in and out of the garage to and fro. Terec came over and helped me out for a bit as well.</p>  <p>The first thing I checked was to see what the starter looked like, I was worried based on the noises that I’ve been hearing that the newly installed starter was bad. Well I pulled it out, it looked fine, as did the flywheel itself, so there went that theory. I put the started back on the car and connected the wires. From there I attempted to start the car again. The grinding happened a bit, but I swear it doesn’t last, and even got less frequent as the night wore on.</p>  <p>Terec showed up as i was attempting to start the car. We spent most of the evening trying multiple things, rewiring the VR sensor for the megasquirt was the main thing. I attempted it multiple ways, running some new wires for the sensor, and trying different combinations of connections on the wires. At the end of the night we really didn’t seem to get anywhere. Throwing the timing light on the car it does appear to be close to the correct timing, though I need to find TDC again tomorrow night and check to make sure that the VR sensor is 60 degrees from the missing tooth on the wheel.</p>  <p>The last attempt at starting the car seemed to only get 100rpm from the starter, so we assume that the battery was drained a bit too much. Because of that we threw it on the charger and called it a night.</p>  <p>Another thing that just struck me, I need to check the compression on the motor tomorrow, that hasn’t been done :(</p>",2009-05-27 00:42:38.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/422/Another-night-with-not-much-success
"A little success, found 1 of 3 missing screws, AND the car started, twice!",a-little-success-found-1-of-3-missing-screws-and,"<p>So last night after work I came home with the intention of trying to figure out why the car wouldn’t start. My intentions were to check the positioning of the 36-1 wheel for the VR sensor that drives the Megasquirt/EDIS setup. After checking the positioning of the sensor I was going to do a compression check on the motor. Well I threw those intentions out of the window, I wanted to see if after charging the battery the night before things would be better as the changes from the night before were not completely tested due to the drained battery.</p>  <p>Well wouldn’t you know, the car started! And not just once, but twice! It actually even ran for a bit, assuming I had my foot on the pedal, otherwise it would die, but that didn’t concern me, not yet. So it ran, and I have <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.project240z.com/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=dJFjBN11jRw%3d&amp;tabid=36"">megasquirt log files to prove it</a>! I went to try to start it again, and got nothing, but this time it wasn’t timing, it wasn’t motor, it was the starter. The starter wouldn’t turn over, it would only click, which made things really weird because I hadn’t had that problem before. Rather than trying to make it work I simply decided to pull the starter out of the car and check it out, it looked okay.</p>  <p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/3572141060/""><img alt=""Starter after pulling it out"" width=""240"" height=""180"" src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2472/3572141060_2f6ed34481_m.jpg"" /></a></p>  <p>I decided I would take a picture of the flywheel, and as soon as I took a picture I noticed something shining off the flash.</p>  <p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/3571337775/""><img alt=""Starter won't turn over, wonder why?"" width=""180"" height=""240"" src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3393/3571337775_18b0c7c815_m.jpg"" /></a></p>  <p>As soon as I took a second look at it I knew exactly what it was.

I worked on cleaning up some things in the garage, I need to get it up on jack stands and find the remaining 2 screws which I believe are also still in the bell housing. Perhaps this weekend, or early next week I’ll get it up and find them.</p>  <p>I also started disassembling the old block, crank and pistons as I need to get rid of those here soon, especially if we find out about our home offer soon (<a href=""http://www.going2colorado.com"">http://www.going2colorado.com</a>)</p>  <p>Here’s a brief video of today’s work, nothing too fascinating, next time I have it running I’ll get audio!</p>  <p>[YouTube:eTCFkNBJIQI]</p>",2009-05-29 00:50:32.000,html,,,/Video/itemId/423/A-little-success-found-1-of-3-missing-screws-AND
"It runs, twice and there&rsquo;s audio/video proof!",it-runs-twice-and-there&rsquo;s-audio/video-proo,"<p>So tonight after work I came home to get the starter out of the car and took it back to Autozone, fortunately the lifetime warranty was honored! Though I did have to run off to the Autozone Hub to get the replacement starter. The guy at the hub was kind of lost, but he eventually got everything worked out and I headed home with the new (remanufactured) starter.</p>  <p>So the last starter started off working, but after a few days just started spinning without engaging the flywheel, no grinding either. This one, once all wired up worked like a champ. I even got the car started up for a minute or so. I did all this without hooking up the computer, so I didn’t want to spend too much time keeping it running.</p>  <p>So now was the time, time to hookup the laptop and get the video camera out and record the car actually running! Well I am proud to say it was successful, here’s the video below.</p>  <p>[YouTube:yDbK33E7Tfw]</p>",2009-06-10 01:37:25.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/424/It-runs-twice-and-there&rsquo;s-audio/video-proo
Starting on the suspension,starting-on-the-suspension,"<p>With the <a href=""http://www.project240z.com/Blog/itemId/424/It-runs-twice-and-therersquos-audiovideo-proof.aspx"" target=""_blank"">success last night</a> I decided I had to work on the car this evening a bit. The first thing I did was get it up on all four jack stands so that they were under the frame and not under control arms of the car. This would allow me to begin working on the suspension pieces. </p>  <p>When I got the car from Jeff, uhhh over three years ago now, it came with a second suspension that had been pulled off another car. This other suspension has springs (yellow), new(er) struts, a larger front sway bar, and also the addition of a rear sway bar. It also is a lot cleaner then the current suspension. So tonight I started pulling off the front suspension, starting with the sway bar, and moving on to removing the rest, at least what I could, of the right front.</p>  <p>I got stuck at the tie rod, but I did manage to get most of the other bolts removed. I came to a conclusion though, I’m going to likely just drop the whole front suspension out, including the cross member as the second suspension has one as well. In order to do that though I am going to have to dismount the motor. I will attempt to do that by lifting the motor up off the mounts with the cherry picker, hopefully without having to disconnect the transmission and not removing the whole thing from the car.</p>  <p>Before I do that though I will likely fully disassemble the other suspension and take it to a friend’s house to sandblast everything. I’m heading to Tampa for a conference tomorrow, so that will have to wait until the evenings next week. I’ll try to get everything disassembled during the week, both front and rear suspensions, and then probably go down to his place Saturday if he’ll be around.</p>",2009-06-10 22:17:08.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/425/Starting-on-the-suspension
Power washing the second suspension,power-washing-the-second-suspension,"<p>We got back from Colorado on Saturday night. Sunday afternoon I was out in the driveway power washing the extra suspension for the 240z. I got quite a bit done, it looks a lot better than before, and I also managed to get most of the disassembled so that I could get it sand blasted. I did manage to get grease all over the driveway though, which then go on the dogs when Natalie decided to try to wash the dogs in the driveway while I was out there. Whoops! Lesson learned, grease gets everywhere.</p>  <p>I’ll hopefully have some time this weekend to get down to Egypt (my boss, with the sandblaster, lives way down in the sticks of MO) to work on sandblasting some of the parts so they can be painted and then reassembled. I’ll take pictures if any of that happens!</p>",2009-06-23 01:36:38.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/426/Power-washing-the-second-suspension
Back on the wagon,back-on-the-wagon,"<p>So I finally got some more time on the Datsun over the past few days. Friday I went down to my boss’ house and used his bead blaster to clean up some of the suspension pieces (photos of those later this week).</p>  <p>Today I needed to relax a bit (for the reason read this blog post) so I went into the garage and decided to pull the rear hatch off the car. I’m going to try to get rid of all the extra parts I have in the next week or two, and a hatch is one of the extras so I wanted to get the one off the car. That process went pretty quickly, and here are the results:</p>  <p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/3692561854/""><img alt=""Hatch Removed"" src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2579/3692561854_980c2b6ca4_m.jpg"" width=""240"" height=""180"" /></a>&#160;<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/3692566252/""><img alt=""Old (blue) and New (brown)"" src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2462/3692566252_64e462c792_m.jpg"" width=""240"" height=""180"" /></a></p>  <p>The blue one being the one I will be getting rid of, and the brown one being the one I want to put on the car.</p>  <p>After that I started playing around with some paint stripper.Here’s the result of that.</p>  <p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/3691765155/""><img alt=""Paint Stripper"" src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2542/3691765155_b35c47ffca_m.jpg"" width=""240"" height=""180"" /></a></p>  <p>I don’t think I want to buy enough stripper to spray down the whole car! That’ll be a lot of chemicals, though it does end up cleaner than if I went to completely sand the whole car down.</p>  <p>More work later this week.</p>",2009-07-05 23:52:31.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/427/Back-on-the-wagon
"Prepping the car for the move, putting the suspension back together",prepping-the-car-for-the-move-putting-the-suspen,"<p>Tonight I came home and started putting the suspension back together. Fortunately I hadn’t gotten too far with taking it apart, so I didn’t have too much to put back together. I decided since we only have a couple of weeks left I won’t try getting the other suspension under the car, I’ll just worry about getting it together and secured for the trailer ride to Colorado (<a href=""http://www.going2colorado.com"">http://www.going2colorado.com</a>) later this month.</p>  <p>I got the front suspension bits together, though I didn’t bother to put the sway bar on for now. I then decided to pull the steering column to get the new one put into the car.

"Packing the garage, driving the car",packing-the-garage-driving-the-car,"<p>So today was spent packing the garage (<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.going2colorado.com/Blog/itemId/143/Packing-up-the-Garage.aspx"">read about that over here</a>). While getting things packed up made it a productive day, the real joy was with the car. I drove it today!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It has been over 23 months since the car last moved under it’s own power, so getting it out of the driveway (harder than it sounds) and driving it around the circle made for a great day.</p>  <p>The car is still hard to start, but once it starts up the first time it generally starts up easier (as you will see in the video). I then had trouble trying to get into gear, keep the car running, and letting off the brake as the ebrake isn’t strong enough to keep it at the top of our driveway. I finally just let the car roll down the driveway and started it at the bottom before driving it around. If you want to see it running and driving skip ahead in the video to around 6 minutes.

Out goes the dash,out-goes-the-dash,"<p>So tonight after work I got the 240Z off the trailer, both of which had been parked in the Garage since we moved to Colorado a few weeks ago. I had lined up a storage lot for the trailer and wanted to get it out of the garage. Well the 240Z wasn’t easy to start, took a good 5+ minutes of attempts before it finally started up. Later in the day I realized the MAP hose wasn’t hooked up to the Megasquirt, that would explain the difficulty in starting! whoops.</p>  <p>So I dropped the trailer off and came home to organize the garage a bit, moved the newly assembled shelves in place and started going through some of my boxes. After I got bored with the unpacking I decided it was a good time to put all the bulbs and fuses that I had purchased yesterday into the car. That was pretty quick and painless, but didn’t produce any fruit! I didn’t see any lights in the rear of the car at all. So what next?</p>  <p>I simply decided to pull the dashboard out! The whole thing, gone, removed, not going back in (likely not) along with the blower and heater core. Why might you ask? Why not. The car will hopefully be somewhat streetable, but I won’t be using most of the gauges on the car anyways. For a speedo I’ll have the G2X (GPS data logging), for RPM I’ll likely have the G2X, or even a Netbook running the Megasquirt software to show me all the appropriate date from the ECU. So why do I need the stock dash? I don’t! Though I did realize after I pulled the dash that I left the fiberlass dashboard in St. Louis, and didn’t bring it to CO. Luckily I’m going back to STL next week for work and will hopefully get it packed up and shipped back.</p>  <p>I’ll need to do some creative wiring, hooking up a switch for the headlights, a horn, turn signals, and even the ignition, but I think it will be cool to have all those as switchable items on a nice clean looking dashboard, not the big old clunky stock one. </p>  <p>Here’s a photo sans dash.</p>  <p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/3832794826/""><img alt=""Sans Dashboard"" src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3448/3832794826_2bf00d6e2c_m.jpg"" width=""240"" height=""180"" /></a></p>",2009-08-18 00:56:52.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/434/Out-goes-the-dash

I was going to drive the car around the block tonight, and park it in the third car garage, but I quickly realized that wasn’t going to happen unless I wanted to take the wiring harness out of the old dash and hook up the wires. Right now the ignition wires aren’t going to anything, so that would make it kind of hard to start the car and drive it. Oh well, I moved it around a bit by hand and made room for one of our cars in the garage at least, the F350 will have to stay outside for a while longer.</p>  <p>Hopefully by the end of September I’ll either have a new quieter exhaust on the car, or all the paint completely stripped off, or maybe even both!</p>",2009-08-24 00:59:55.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/435/Organizing-the-garage-and-guess-what-I-found?

Fuse block/panel acquired,fuse-block/panel-acquired,"<p>So I have been delaying wiring up the car a bit, partially because I don’t understand it all, and partially because I am afraid! I’m a computer geek, but not always the best when it comes to working on the car, I question everything I do, maybe because I blew up the last motor?</p>  <p>Part of the wiring problem I’ve had is that I needed to get a fuse block to start hooking things up to, the original block had melted long ago, and only half worked. Last night I went to PepBoys and CarToys looking to see if I could find anything, with no luck. Today I decided to try Napa, SCORE! I actually got two different blocks. One 6 pole and one 10 pole, that way I can break things up if necessary. I hope to get the wiring started this weekend, I would like to attempt to have the car running again, which I think really just means I need to get a switch wired for the starter.</p>  <p>I’m not going to deal with a key for the car, this car long run isn’t going to be something someone will be able to walk up and start anyways.</p>  <p>So we’ll see how far I get, I may also have to go look at this on Saturday…. <a href=""http://www.toolking.com/hobartwelders_500500a.aspx"">http://www.toolking.com/hobartwelders_500500a.aspx</a></p>",2009-10-02 00:10:40.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/438/Fuse-block/panel-acquired

After ripping out the dash I've been unable to get the car started, rather than continuing to try to make the stock ignition work I decided to just give up on that, and scrap the stock fuse block.</p>  <p>I picked up a few fuse blocks from Napa a week or so ago, and yesterday started working on doing the wiring to use those blocks.</p>  <p>The video isn't all that entertaining, but I did come up with a cool angle towards the end of the video. I ended up not having the equipment I needed. I ordered more stuff last night and should have it tomorrow, so I can get working on the car this weekend. Now, check out the video!</p>  <p>[YouTube:E-yBMqf5nR8]</p>",2009-10-08 18:05:00.000,html,,,/Video/itemId/439/Back-in-action-in-the-garage-First-video-from-Co
Should I make the 240Z Electric?,should-i-make-the-240z-electric?,"<p>Today, while I was hard at work, a buddy of mine sent me a link to a car on Ebay, it was a <a href=""http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/1984-GTI-RABBIT-517-ORIGINAL-MILES-ORIGINAL-OWNER_W0QQitemZ130335847774QQcmdZViewItemQQptZUS_Cars_Trucks?hash=item1e589f355e#ht_500wt_1182"">1984 Rabbit GTI with 517 original mile</a>s. I was looking at the car in amazement, seeing it was in St. Louis, and more so in Creve Couer, near where we used to live.</p>  <p>From there I clicked on another link, I'm not even sure which one, and I came across a list of cars, one that peaked my interest, a <a href=""http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/Electric-Car-1957-Porsche-356-Speedster-Replica_W0QQitemZ260484651636QQcmdZViewItemQQptZUS_Cars_Trucks?hash=item3ca6185a74"">356 speedster replica</a>. I decided to check it out, and then I started reading more realizing it was also local to St. Louis, but get this. It is electric!&#160;I thought, oh that's cool, but then I scrolled down and started watching the video embedded into the ebay page. I'm 68 minutes into it, it's a 91 minute video.</p>  <p>This is awesome, I so want to turn the 240Z into an electric car now! I know a guy who works for <a href=""http://www.a123systems.com/"">A123Systems</a>, I wonder if I couldn't get a good deal on some batteries? :)&#160;</p>  <p>If you've got some time to kill, check out the video!

"Megasquirt woes, too much fuel?",megasquirt-woes-too-much-fuel?,"<p>So I will start this post off staying this: I know nothing, I am a noob when it comes to the megasquirt, and tuning a fuel injection car (or a carb’d car for that matter). </p>  <p>That being said, I think my megasquirt is giving the car too much fuel when it’s trying to start. I don’t know how to prove this, other than to learn how to mess with the fuel map for the megasquirt and see if I can’t back off the fuel a big when trying to start the car. The car doesn’t like to start, it’s very hesitant to do so, and&#160; to me it just sounds like it’s flooded and can’t ignite because of this. I’ll have to do some reading here over the next week or so to see if I can’t figure it out and get the car to reliably start.</p>  <p>I did start to adjust the fuel map a bit this afternoon but ended up not getting enough juice from the battery to power the starter and the fuel pump at the same time, so I’ve got the battery on the charge. The charger has been getting a workout today as it was plugged into an 89 RX-7 for a few hours while I charged the battery on that ride up so it can be loaded on the transport truck later today (if the guy ever shows up).</p>  <p>Earlier this week I did manage to get the datsun started, and even backed it out of the garage, but I couldn’t keep it running enough to drive it back in so I had to push it. I moved it over into the third bay so that I could make room for the F250 to park inside for the winter. That truck is huge, barely fits into our 24ft garage (we also have 18” shelves in front of it), but it does fit, so that made the wife exceptionally happy!</p>  <p>I’ll try to get some new photos of the Datsun later this week. I may start doing some body work prep on it, I have a coupon for a maaco paint job for $275, so I think I’ll get some bondo out to smooth out some rough spots and get it ready for paint. Bondo? Maaco? I don’t see any value in putting a lot of money into the exterior of this Datsun at this point. I just need it to run, and not be 5 different colors, so I’ll take it to Maaco for a flat black paint job and be done with it!</p>",2009-10-24 19:15:52.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/446/Megasquirt-woes-too-much-fuel?
No seats! and check out our sister site,no-seats-and-check-out-our-sister-site,"<p>So I don’t know why I didn’t think of this a month ago, would have saved me some money on shipping, but the Corbeau A4s for the 240z are sold. John V, the guy who bought the <a href=""http://www.corvettez06.org"">Corvette</a> has purchased them for use in his RX-7 that I bought and shipped to him a few weeks ago. Would have made sense to pack the seats in the car then, but I didn’t realize he was going to be interested in them, oh well.</p>  <p>On an unrelated note, have you checked out our sister-site, <a href=""http://www.project350z.com/"">Project350z.com</a>? You might ask, but you don’t even have a 350Z? True, but I will, at least that’s the plan, to get another one in early 2010 so I can have a car to race next year. I’ve spent a few hours over the past few sick evenings sorting through photos of the old car, which just makes me miss not having a 350Z that much more. I posted photos and got a site design together, though I don’t have much other content up there yet, it will take a few months to get it all together, hopefully just in time to get myself a new (used) ride.</p>  <p>Dozzle, if you read this, I still want to buy my old car back!!!!</p>",2009-11-19 17:10:59.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/451/No-seats-and-check-out-our-sister-site

1973 Datsun 240z For Sale,1973-datsun-240z-for-sale,"<p><strong>THIS CAR HAS BEEN SOLD, NO LONGER AVAILABLE</strong></p>  <p>So I really am looking to sell the 240z this time around. Though, the more time I spend on it, the less I want to sell it, so perhaps I’ll continue working on it while I wait to see if it sells, and then who knows what will happen after that. At this point in time I’m not looking to part the car out, that might change in the future, but for now I’ll keep from parting it out.</p>  <p><strong><a title=""1973 Datsun 240z For Sale"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/4238280441/""><img border=""0"" alt=""1973 Datsun 240z For Sale"" align=""right"" src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2691/4238280441_9a8a9d889e_m.jpg"" /></a>Basics:       <br />  </strong>Price: $1750 with all the spare parts (storage bins full), $1250 with the car as it currently sits.

I have a California title from a previous owner, I’ve signed it, but never got it titled in my name. It is going to cost me a couple hundred dollars to get the title in my name due to fees, if the purchaser needs a title we can have this done.</p>  <p><strong>Engine:      <br />  </strong>L28E from a 1977 Datsun 280z 2+2     <br />  Intake/Exhaust Manifolds from a 1983 280ZX Turbo     <br />  Turbo from a 1983 280ZX Turbo     <br />  Oil cooler not currently installed, bypassed, parts all there.     <br />  Exhaust, straight pipe coming off the turbo, currently dumps under the driver     <br />  <em>Thoughts:</em> The motor runs, though it is a tad picky to start. I’m pretty sure it’s a combination of the manifolds and megasquirt needing some adjustment, knowledge I just don’t have.</p>  <p><strong>Transmission:</strong>     <br />  5 Speed from 1977 Datsun 280z 2+2, new urethane bushings on transmission mount.     <br />  <em>Thoughts:</em> Transmission works great as far as I know, worked in the parts car that I got it out of, and also drove fine with the previous motor in this car.</p>  <p><strong>Fuel System:</strong>     <br />  Tank: 15 Gallon Fuel Cell     <br />  Pump: High Pressure Pump (<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.jegs.com/i/MSD/121/2225/10002/-1"">from Jegs</a>)     <br />  Lines: Stainless steel primarily 8AN&#160; <br />  Rail: Custom aluminum rail from Lonewolf Performance     <br />  Injectors: Ford Racing 42lb/hr     <br />  Pressure Regulator     <br />  <em>Thoughts: </em>No known issues with the fuel system, everything works as it should.</p>  <p><strong>ECU:</strong>     <br />  Megasquirt (purchased/assembled from DIYAutoTune)     <br />  MS130-C Assembled Megasquirt-I with V3.0 PCB     <br />  MOD_130-EDIS: EDIS mods     <br />  MSStim22-C     <br />  LG-Wirebund     <br />  LC-1 without gauge     <br />  <em>Thoughts:</em> As far as I know everything works great with the Megasquirt, the only issues are that I don’t know enough to properly tune everything.</p>  <p><strong>Suspension:</strong>     <br />  Stock 1973 240Z     <br />  Spare suspension parts also off a 1973 240z, w/ front/rear sway bars (spares not included for $1250)     <br />  I have a urethane bushing kit for the car, but so far have only put bushings into the steering coupler and the transmission cross member. (kit not included at $1250 price)     <br />  <em>Thoughts:</em> The suspension is something I intended to address after having the car together, painted, and running.</p>  <p><strong>Wheels/Tires:</strong>     <br />  Stock steel wheels, R-Compound Hoosier Tires     <br />  <em>Thoughts:</em> Nothing special here</p>  <p><strong>Interior:</strong>     <br />  Seats: None     <br />  Dash: Removed, fiberglass dash available (dash not included at $1250)     <br />  Carpet: None     <br />  Paint: Interior painted in a black undercoating, except for the dash area which was removed after paint.     <br />  <em>Thoughts:</em> The interior needs some love depending on your intentions. I had planned to put a cage in, but haven’t had it done. I had some Corbeau A4 seats in the car, on custom welded in mounts, but the seats were too tall. Putting in other seats may require some fabrication work. My intention was to put in a race seat.</p>  <p><strong>Body:</strong>     <br />  Hood and headlight buckets from a 1977 280Z 2+2     <br />  Doors and rear hatch (w/ spoiler) from a different 73 240z     <br />  Air Dam, not sure of make, needs paint scraped off and painted.     <br />  <em>Thoughts:</em> Passenger floor pan had some rust, cut out and welded in new metal. Floor then covered in fiberglass. The rust doesn’t appear too bad elsewhere, but I’ve not stripped the car looking for things. The body definitely needs some love and a paint job to get the car cleaned up. The passenger door needs some adjustment, it doesn’t close easily but will shut and stay closed.</p>  <p><strong>Pictures and Video:      <br />  </strong>I posted a lot of pictures of the car that I took yesterday, you can see them on <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/sets/72157623124463062/"">this Flickr Set</a>.

I’ve had it for three and a half years now, and I would love to have the time to finish it, but to be honest I haven’t had time over the past 3.5 years, I don’t foresee having the time/motivation to do it anytime soon. I’m not going to part the car out, and if it doesn’t sell, perhaps i will find the time to do more on the car. I spent a few hours cleaning things up yesterday and renewed my motivation to want to work on the car, but still not enough to decide not to sell it.</p>  <p>If you are interested looking at the car please use the contact form here on Project240z.com, the car is only available on the weekends to be looked at right now.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>The two domain names, <a href=""http://www.project240z.com"">www.project240z.com</a> and <a href=""http://www.240z.net"">www.240z.net</a> are not included in this sale, but may be available if someone is interested in those.</p>",2010-01-03 15:56:15.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/458/1973-Datsun-240z-For-Sale

Project240z 10 Years Later,project240z-10-years-later,"<p>Ten years ago today, the 240z took its first, and last, autocross run at Gateway Motorsports Park, in Illinois.</p><p> <a title=""IMG_3178"" href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/1099789651/"" data-footer=""true"" data-flickr-embed=""true""><img width=""500"" height=""333"" alt=""IMG_3178"" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1337/1099789651_2c9cdb1f4a.jpg""></a><script async src=""//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script> </p><p>The poor car didn’t even get to finish it’s first run, blowing a hole in the block before making it across the finish line.</p><p> <a title=""IMG_3214"" href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/1099962521/in/photostream/"" data-footer=""true"" data-flickr-embed=""true""><img width=""500"" height=""333"" alt=""IMG_3214"" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1126/1099962521_74ca8f47dc.jpg""></a><script async src=""//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script> </p><p>Lesson learned from the day: Don’t get anxious and compete in a car before it is complete.

Looking for another 240z,looking-for-another-240z,"<p>It has been a little while since we&#39;ve owned a Datsun 240z and we&#39;re somewhat ready for another! If you&#39;ve got an old Datsun in the St. Louis Area, or anywhere within a couple hour drive, hit us up, we&#39;re interested in talking to you about it.</p>  ",2020-05-08 14:37:30.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/579/Looking-for-another-240z
