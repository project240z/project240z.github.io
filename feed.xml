        <title>Looking for another 240z</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been a little while since we've owned a Datsun 240z and we're somewhat ready for another! If you've got an old Datsun in the St. Louis Area, or anywhere within a couple hour drive, hit us up, we're interested in talking to you about it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Project240z 10 Years Later</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago today, the 240z took its first, and last, autocross run at Gateway Motorsports Park, in Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;IMG_3178&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/1099789651/&quot; data-footer=&quot;true&quot; data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_3178&quot; src=&quot;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1337/1099789651_2c9cdb1f4a.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The poor car didn’t even get to finish it’s first run, blowing a hole in the block before making it across the finish line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;IMG_3214&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/1099962521/in/photostream/&quot; data-footer=&quot;true&quot; data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_3214&quot; src=&quot;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1126/1099962521_74ca8f47dc.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lesson learned from the day: Don’t get anxious and compete in a car before it is complete. I hadn’t tuned the car properly, and likely ran it to lean (also didn’t record any of the data, yet again, too anxious). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 years later, we moved the car to Colorado with us, it drove under its own power at that point, but was sold shortly thereafter as we moved again on to the state of California, where we knew we wouldn’t have the resources to keep/maintain the car.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>This 240z gets around</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Apparently that’s the word on the 240z. I sold it in January 2010 (or somewhere close to there) and since then it has apparently changed owners twice (possibly more).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I emailed &lt;a href=&quot;/the-240z-lives-and-it-looks-great&quot;&gt;the guy who sent me photos in October after he painted it&lt;/a&gt;, to see how it was, and he tells me it was sold in December 
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are the new owner, drop me a line, I’m curious how things are going.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The 240z Lives! and it looks great!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So it’s been a while since I’ve blogged here on Project240z.com, reason being that I sold the car quite a while ago. Back this summer I got an email from a guy telling me he was the new owner, having purchased it from the guy that I sold it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, a couple weeks ago I got these in my inbox:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Project240z Lives with a new owner&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/5174189086/&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Project240z Lives with a new owner&quot; src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/4092/5174189086_52d64c152e.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a title=&quot;Project240z Lives with a new owner&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/5174188330/&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Project240z Lives with a new owner&quot; src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/4110/5174188330_980c8249fa.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a title=&quot;Project240z Lives with a new owner&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/5173582669/&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Project240z Lives with a new owner&quot; src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/4090/5173582669_345c4f0614.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a title=&quot;Project240z Lives with a new owner&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/5174187160/&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Project240z Lives with a new owner&quot; src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/4112/5174187160_abb106c135.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cried a little bit. The car looks great, it has a motor in it, and it even has license plates! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m glad he sent them to be, but it definitely makes me sad, to see the car up and running, all one color, I had it 4 years and never had it looking that good! Great work, I hope to hear more about the car in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m still debating what is going on with the 350z, one day I want to trade it and get an EVO or STI, other days I want to keep it and put a turbo on it. We’ll see, for now I imagine it will stick around because we’ve got a lot of other things going on and the budget doesn’t necessarily allow for a turbo AWD right now.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>NorCal UFO Autocross, The Night Before</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, it looks like it is finally time to autocross the beast again! It’s been since January. I’m headed to the Northern California United 510 Owner’s club autocross tomorrow in Marina, CA. Hopefully the car holds together and makes it there, runs, and makes it home! I’m curious to see if the leaky exhaust causes me any troubles (sound level, or just w/ people).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m probably going to run in BSP, I don’t think that UFO follows the standard SCCA Classes for 2010, so STR or SSM are out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photos and video tomorrow night.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://mywifeisfaster.blogspot.com/2010/01/saying-goodbye.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;idea blatantly stolen from James Nelson’s Saying Goodbye post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;CJH_06-05-07-10-02-39 by chrishammond, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/4140330336/&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display: inline; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px&quot; alt=&quot;CJH_06-05-07-10-02-39&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2488/4140330336_61e4511b6a_m.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;160&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We’ve been together for almost 4 years, you and I. I was love at first site, but it took a internet chat conversation with 4 guys to get you where I wanted you. Once your previous owner let a price slip I jumped on the opportunity to buy you, and a week later you, and a billion parts, were loaded up into a trailer for the trip home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got you home and you fit right in next to your younger sister, it wasn’t long before she left our family to join Dozzle in Kansas City (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.project350z.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;she’s been recently reincarnated though&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a title=&quot;CJH_06-05-07-15-55-11 by chrishammond, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/4139593465/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;CJH_06-05-07-15-55-11&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2572/4139593465_736007c3d4_m.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;160&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next 6 months you didn’t get much attention, but you did gain an unsightly brother, a 1978 2+2 that you would learn to love later in life, as he provided a replacement heart for you, along with eye sockets and chest plate to cover the heart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;CJH_06-05-15-18-48-26 by chrishammond, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/4321433512/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;CJH_06-05-15-18-48-26&quot; src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2729/4321433512_984788c373_m.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;160&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In June, about a month after you did start off strong in June by losing your inner self. That was the start of something beautiful, you became an internet star, getting thousands upon thousands of views of your videos. You even show up &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;source=hp&amp;amp;q=240z&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;very high in the search results for 240z&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;object width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;350&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/MgUDgNx-sBg&quot;/&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/MgUDgNx-sBg&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; /&gt;&lt;/object&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It was the spring of 2007 before any real progress was made on you, with the very generous help of many friends you got a new heart. With that new heart you even got to stretch your legs a bit in July and August of that year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;object width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;350&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/n2PkfumfCNk&quot;/&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/n2PkfumfCNk&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; /&gt;&lt;/object&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though you didn’t even get to complete the full run, I had to get out and assist you, and recruit other help as well, to get back to your grid position.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;IMG_3262 by chrishammond, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/1100201961/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;IMG_3262&quot; src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1315/1100201961_16bcdff5fe_m.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;160&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Drained by chrishammond, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/1121489208/&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display: inline; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px&quot; alt=&quot;Drained&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1107/1121489208_b95723354c_m.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;160&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;You punished me for taking you out for an autocross too early in your recovery, and showed me your displeasure by destroying the number 2 piston, and providing a nice beautiful mix of oil and coolant when I get you home and drained you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this incident you sat for a quite a while, really until late 2008, you lived partially in a warehouse, sometimes in the garage in Missouri. Though with a little effort you got a new heart put in, you even got to cruise around the neighborhood one last time before being loaded onto the trailer and taken to our new home in Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;object width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;350&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/pbd7GbTyAiU&quot;/&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/pbd7GbTyAiU&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; /&gt;&lt;/object&gt;

You did get some attention here and there, but new priorities in life got in the way of the real attention you needed. It was then decided that you would be better served by finding a new owner. Today that new owner came and took you away. I hope you enjoy your new life, you were my first real project car, and while I never completed you, I am greatful for the time we spent together. I will miss you 240z, perhaps one day in the future I may run into one of your twins.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tis sold</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So this won’t be the final post here on Project240z.com, but we are likely coming close to the end. This weekend the car sold, an airman from the local Air Force base in Denver came by and gave me a deposit for the car. I’m going to try to get the title cleaned up this week and hopefully get it to him this weekend if he comes up with the rest of the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll post again when the car is gone. Thanks for all the interest in the car lately, unfortunately 99% of the interest came after I sold the car, not before, but oh well. For now check out my new toy, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.project350z.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.project350z.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>1973 Datsun 240z For Sale</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THIS CAR HAS BEEN SOLD, NO LONGER AVAILABLE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I really am looking to sell the 240z this time around. Though, the more time I spend on it, the less I want to sell it, so perhaps I’ll continue working on it while I wait to see if it sells, and then who knows what will happen after that. At this point in time I’m not looking to part the car out, that might change in the future, but for now I’ll keep from parting it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;1973 Datsun 240z For Sale&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/4238280441/&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;1973 Datsun 240z For Sale&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2691/4238280441_9a8a9d889e_m.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Basics:       &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;/strong&gt;Price: $1750 with all the spare parts (storage bins full), $1250 with the car as it currently sits. (add $250 to clean up title)     &lt;br /&gt;  Year:1973     &lt;br /&gt;  Make: Datsun     &lt;br /&gt;  Model: 240z     &lt;br /&gt;  Title: None (can be acquired at additional cost)     &lt;br /&gt;  Mileage: Unknown     &lt;br /&gt;  Location: Parker, Colorado (delivery available at $1.25.mile up to 500 miles from Parker, CO)     &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Thoughts:&lt;/em&gt; Depending on the needs, I can get the title cleared up on this car. I have a California title from a previous owner, I’ve signed it, but never got it titled in my name. It is going to cost me a couple hundred dollars to get the title in my name due to fees, if the purchaser needs a title we can have this done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engine:      &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;/strong&gt;L28E from a 1977 Datsun 280z 2+2     &lt;br /&gt;  Intake/Exhaust Manifolds from a 1983 280ZX Turbo     &lt;br /&gt;  Turbo from a 1983 280ZX Turbo     &lt;br /&gt;  Oil cooler not currently installed, bypassed, parts all there.     &lt;br /&gt;  Exhaust, straight pipe coming off the turbo, currently dumps under the driver     &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Thoughts:&lt;/em&gt; The motor runs, though it is a tad picky to start. I’m pretty sure it’s a combination of the manifolds and megasquirt needing some adjustment, knowledge I just don’t have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transmission:&lt;/strong&gt;     &lt;br /&gt;  5 Speed from 1977 Datsun 280z 2+2, new urethane bushings on transmission mount.     &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Thoughts:&lt;/em&gt; Transmission works great as far as I know, worked in the parts car that I got it out of, and also drove fine with the previous motor in this car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fuel System:&lt;/strong&gt;     &lt;br /&gt;  Tank: 15 Gallon Fuel Cell     &lt;br /&gt;  Pump: High Pressure Pump (&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.jegs.com/i/MSD/121/2225/10002/-1&quot;&gt;from Jegs&lt;/a&gt;)     &lt;br /&gt;  Lines: Stainless steel primarily 8AN&amp;#160; &lt;br /&gt;  Rail: Custom aluminum rail from Lonewolf Performance     &lt;br /&gt;  Injectors: Ford Racing 42lb/hr     &lt;br /&gt;  Pressure Regulator     &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Thoughts: &lt;/em&gt;No known issues with the fuel system, everything works as it should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ECU:&lt;/strong&gt;     &lt;br /&gt;  Megasquirt (purchased/assembled from DIYAutoTune)     &lt;br /&gt;  MS130-C Assembled Megasquirt-I with V3.0 PCB     &lt;br /&gt;  MOD_130-EDIS: EDIS mods     &lt;br /&gt;  MSStim22-C     &lt;br /&gt;  LG-Wirebund     &lt;br /&gt;  LC-1 without gauge     &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Thoughts:&lt;/em&gt; As far as I know everything works great with the Megasquirt, the only issues are that I don’t know enough to properly tune everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suspension:&lt;/strong&gt;     &lt;br /&gt;  Stock 1973 240Z     &lt;br /&gt;  Spare suspension parts also off a 1973 240z, w/ front/rear sway bars (spares not included for $1250)     &lt;br /&gt;  I have a urethane bushing kit for the car, but so far have only put bushings into the steering coupler and the transmission cross member. (kit not included at $1250 price)     &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Thoughts:&lt;/em&gt; The suspension is something I intended to address after having the car together, painted, and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wheels/Tires:&lt;/strong&gt;     &lt;br /&gt;  Stock steel wheels, R-Compound Hoosier Tires     &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Thoughts:&lt;/em&gt; Nothing special here&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interior:&lt;/strong&gt;     &lt;br /&gt;  Seats: None     &lt;br /&gt;  Dash: Removed, fiberglass dash available (dash not included at $1250)     &lt;br /&gt;  Carpet: None     &lt;br /&gt;  Paint: Interior painted in a black undercoating, except for the dash area which was removed after paint.     &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Thoughts:&lt;/em&gt; The interior needs some love depending on your intentions. I had planned to put a cage in, but haven’t had it done. I had some Corbeau A4 seats in the car, on custom welded in mounts, but the seats were too tall. Putting in other seats may require some fabrication work. My intention was to put in a race seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Body:&lt;/strong&gt;     &lt;br /&gt;  Hood and headlight buckets from a 1977 280Z 2+2     &lt;br /&gt;  Doors and rear hatch (w/ spoiler) from a different 73 240z     &lt;br /&gt;  Air Dam, not sure of make, needs paint scraped off and painted.     &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Thoughts:&lt;/em&gt; Passenger floor pan had some rust, cut out and welded in new metal. Floor then covered in fiberglass. The rust doesn’t appear too bad elsewhere, but I’ve not stripped the car looking for things. The body definitely needs some love and a paint job to get the car cleaned up. The passenger door needs some adjustment, it doesn’t close easily but will shut and stay closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pictures and Video:      &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;/strong&gt;I posted a lot of pictures of the car that I took yesterday, you can see them on &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/sets/72157623124463062/&quot;&gt;this Flickr Set&lt;/a&gt;. If you would like to see other photos of specific parts please let me know.     &lt;br /&gt;  I also took a video of the car running yesterday, you can see it starts off rough, but once going doesn’t sound half bad. &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqnifI_7y7I&quot;&gt;Video of the 240z Running&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Thoughts:      &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;/strong&gt;I am torn on selling the car, as you can see in the intro to this post. I’ve had it for three and a half years now, and I would love to have the time to finish it, but to be honest I haven’t had time over the past 3.5 years, I don’t foresee having the time/motivation to do it anytime soon. I’m not going to part the car out, and if it doesn’t sell, perhaps i will find the time to do more on the car. I spent a few hours cleaning things up yesterday and renewed my motivation to want to work on the car, but still not enough to decide not to sell it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested looking at the car please use the contact form here on Project240z.com, the car is only available on the weekends to be looked at right now.&lt;/p&gt;
