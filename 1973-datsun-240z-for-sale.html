			content="THIS CAR HAS BEEN SOLD, NO LONGER AVAILABLE So I really am looking to sell the 240z this time around. Though, the more time I spend on it, the less I want to sell it, so perhaps I’ll continue working on it while I wait to see if it sells, and then who knows what will happen after that. At this point in time I’m not looking to part the car out, that might change in the future, but for now I’ll keep from parting it out. Basics: Price: $1750 with all the spare parts (storage bins full), $1250 with the car as it currently sits. (add $250 to clean up title) Year:1973 Make: Datsun Model: 240z Title: None (can be acquired at additional cost) Mileage: Unknown Location: Parker, Colorado (delivery available at $1.25.mile up to 500 miles from Parker, CO) Thoughts: Depending on the needs, I can get the title cleared up on this car. I have a California title from a previous owner, I’ve signed it, but never got it titled in my name. It is going to cost me a couple hundred dollars to get the title in my name due to fees, if the purchaser needs a title we can have this done. Engine: L28E from a 1977 Datsun 280z 2+2 Intake/Exhaust Manifolds from a 1983 280ZX Turbo Turbo from a 1983 280ZX Turbo Oil cooler not currently installed, bypassed, parts all there. Exhaust, straight pipe coming off the turbo, currently dumps under the driver Thoughts: The motor runs, though it is a tad picky to start. I’m pretty sure it’s a combination of the manifolds and megasquirt needing some adjustment, knowledge I just don’t have. Transmission: 5 Speed from 1977 Datsun 280z 2+2, new urethane bushings on transmission mount. Thoughts: Transmission works great as far as I know, worked in the parts car that I got it out of, and also drove fine with the previous motor in this car. Fuel System: Tank: 15 Gallon Fuel Cell Pump: High Pressure Pump (from Jegs) Lines: Stainless steel primarily 8AN&#160; Rail: Custom aluminum rail from Lonewolf Performance Injectors: Ford Racing 42lb/hr Pressure Regulator Thoughts: No known issues with the fuel system, everything works as it should. ECU: Megasquirt (purchased/assembled from DIYAutoTune) MS130-C Assembled Megasquirt-I with V3.0 PCB MOD_130-EDIS: EDIS mods MSStim22-C LG-Wirebund LC-1 without gauge Thoughts: As far as I know everything works great with the Megasquirt, the only issues are that I don’t know enough to properly tune everything. Suspension: Stock 1973 240Z Spare suspension parts also off a 1973 240z, w/ front/rear sway bars (spares not included for $1250) I have a urethane bushing kit for the car, but so far have only put bushings into the steering coupler and the transmission cross member. (kit not included at $1250 price) Thoughts: The suspension is something I intended to address after having the car together, painted, and running. Wheels/Tires: Stock steel wheels, R-Compound Hoosier Tires Thoughts: Nothing special here Interior: Seats: None Dash: Removed, fiberglass dash available (dash not included at $1250) Carpet: None Paint: Interior painted in a black undercoating, except for the dash area which was removed after paint. Thoughts: The interior needs some love depending on your intentions. I had planned to put a cage in, but haven’t had it done. I had some Corbeau A4 seats in the car, on custom welded in mounts, but the seats were too tall. Putting in other seats may require some fabrication work. My intention was to put in a race seat. Body: Hood and headlight buckets from a 1977 280Z 2+2 Doors and rear hatch (w/ spoiler) from a different 73 240z Air Dam, not sure of make, needs paint scraped off and painted. Thoughts: Passenger floor pan had some rust, cut out and welded in new metal. Floor then covered in fiberglass. The rust doesn’t appear too bad elsewhere, but I’ve not stripped the car looking for things. The body definitely needs some love and a paint job to get the car cleaned up. The passenger door needs some adjustment, it doesn’t close easily but will shut and stay closed. Pictures and Video: I posted a lot of pictures of the car that I took yesterday, you can see them on this Flickr Set. If you would like to see other photos of specific parts please let me know. I also took a video of the car running yesterday, you can see it starts off rough, but once going doesn’t sound half bad. Video of the 240z Running Final Thoughts: I am torn on selling the car, as you can see in the intro to this post. I’ve had it for three and a half years now, and I would love to have the time to finish it, but to be honest I haven’t had time over the past 3.5 years, I don’t foresee having the time/motivation to do it anytime soon. I’m not going to part the car out, and if it doesn’t sell, perhaps i will find the time to do more on the car. I spent a few hours cleaning things up yesterday and renewed my motivation to want to work on the car, but still not enough to decide not to sell it. If you are interested looking at the car please use the contact form here on Project240z.com, the car is only available on the weekends to be looked at right now. &#160; The two domain names, www.project240z.com and www.240z.net are not included in this sale, but may be available if someone is interested in those."

										<strong>THIS CAR HAS BEEN SOLD, NO LONGER AVAILABLE</strong>
									</p>
									<p>
										So I really am looking to sell the 240z this time around.
										Though, the more time I spend on it, the less I want to sell
										it, so perhaps I’ll continue working on it while I wait to
										see if it sells, and then who knows what will happen after
										that. At this point in time I’m not looking to part the car
										out, that might change in the future, but for now I’ll keep
										from parting it out.

											>Basics: <br /> </strong
										>Price: $1750 with all the spare parts (storage bins full),
										$1250 with the car as it currently sits. (add $250 to clean
										up title) <br />
										Year:1973 <br />
										Make: Datsun <br />
										Model: 240z <br />
										Title: None (can be acquired at additional cost) <br />
										Mileage: Unknown <br />
										Location: Parker, Colorado (delivery available at $1.25.mile
										up to 500 miles from Parker, CO) <br />
										<em>Thoughts:</em> Depending on the needs, I can get the
										title cleared up on this car. I have a California title from
										a previous owner, I’ve signed it, but never got it titled in
										my name. It is going to cost me a couple hundred dollars to
										get the title in my name due to fees, if the purchaser needs
										a title we can have this done.
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong>Engine: <br /> </strong>L28E from a 1977 Datsun 280z
										2+2 <br />
										Intake/Exhaust Manifolds from a 1983 280ZX Turbo <br />
										Turbo from a 1983 280ZX Turbo <br />
										Oil cooler not currently installed, bypassed, parts all
										there. <br />
										Exhaust, straight pipe coming off the turbo, currently dumps
										under the driver <br />
										<em>Thoughts:</em> The motor runs, though it is a tad picky
										to start. I’m pretty sure it’s a combination of the
										manifolds and megasquirt needing some adjustment, knowledge
										I just don’t have.
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong>Transmission:</strong> <br />
										5 Speed from 1977 Datsun 280z 2+2, new urethane bushings on
										transmission mount. <br />
										<em>Thoughts:</em> Transmission works great as far as I
										know, worked in the parts car that I got it out of, and also
										drove fine with the previous motor in this car.
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong>Fuel System:</strong> <br />
										Tank: 15 Gallon Fuel Cell <br />
										Pump: High Pressure Pump (<a

										Injectors: Ford Racing 42lb/hr <br />
										Pressure Regulator <br />
										<em>Thoughts: </em>No known issues with the fuel system,
										everything works as it should.
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong>ECU:</strong> <br />
										Megasquirt (purchased/assembled from DIYAutoTune) <br />
										MS130-C Assembled Megasquirt-I with V3.0 PCB <br />
										MOD_130-EDIS: EDIS mods <br />
										MSStim22-C <br />
										LG-Wirebund <br />
										LC-1 without gauge <br />
										<em>Thoughts:</em> As far as I know everything works great
										with the Megasquirt, the only issues are that I don’t know
										enough to properly tune everything.
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong>Suspension:</strong> <br />
										Stock 1973 240Z <br />
										Spare suspension parts also off a 1973 240z, w/ front/rear
										sway bars (spares not included for $1250) <br />
										I have a urethane bushing kit for the car, but so far have
										only put bushings into the steering coupler and the
										transmission cross member. (kit not included at $1250 price)
										<br />
										<em>Thoughts:</em> The suspension is something I intended to
										address after having the car together, painted, and running.
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong>Wheels/Tires:</strong> <br />
										Stock steel wheels, R-Compound Hoosier Tires <br />
										<em>Thoughts:</em> Nothing special here
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong>Interior:</strong> <br />
										Seats: None <br />
										Dash: Removed, fiberglass dash available (dash not included
										at $1250) <br />
										Carpet: None <br />
										Paint: Interior painted in a black undercoating, except for
										the dash area which was removed after paint. <br />
										<em>Thoughts:</em> The interior needs some love depending on
										your intentions. I had planned to put a cage in, but haven’t
										had it done. I had some Corbeau A4 seats in the car, on
										custom welded in mounts, but the seats were too tall.
										Putting in other seats may require some fabrication work. My
										intention was to put in a race seat.
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong>Body:</strong> <br />
										Hood and headlight buckets from a 1977 280Z 2+2 <br />
										Doors and rear hatch (w/ spoiler) from a different 73 240z
										<br />
										Air Dam, not sure of make, needs paint scraped off and
										painted. <br />
										<em>Thoughts:</em> Passenger floor pan had some rust, cut
										out and welded in new metal. Floor then covered in
										fiberglass. The rust doesn’t appear too bad elsewhere, but
										I’ve not stripped the car looking for things. The body
										definitely needs some love and a paint job to get the car
										cleaned up. The passenger door needs some adjustment, it
										doesn’t close easily but will shut and stay closed.
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong>Pictures and Video: <br /> </strong>I posted a lot
										of pictures of the car that I took yesterday, you can see
										them on
										<a
											target="_blank"
											href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/sets/72157623124463062/"
											>this Flickr Set</a
										>. If you would like to see other photos of specific parts
										please let me know. <br />
										I also took a video of the car running yesterday, you can
										see it starts off rough, but once going doesn’t sound half
										bad.

									</p>
									<p>
										<strong>Final Thoughts: <br /> </strong>I am torn on selling
										the car, as you can see in the intro to this post. I’ve had
										it for three and a half years now, and I would love to have
										the time to finish it, but to be honest I haven’t had time
										over the past 3.5 years, I don’t foresee having the
										time/motivation to do it anytime soon. I’m not going to part
										the car out, and if it doesn’t sell, perhaps i will find the
										time to do more on the car. I spent a few hours cleaning
										things up yesterday and renewed my motivation to want to
										work on the car, but still not enough to decide not to sell
										it.
									</p>
									<p>
										If you are interested looking at the car please use the
										contact form here on Project240z.com, the car is only
										available on the weekends to be looked at right now.
