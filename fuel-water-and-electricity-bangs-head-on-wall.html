										Fuel leaks, coolant leaks and blown fuses. That about sums
										up the evening...
									</p>
									<p>
										First off, a HUGE thanks to everyone who came over tonight.
										Henry, Ronnie,&nbsp;Terec, Ian, Eric, Scott and Andy,
										without you guys helping out I wouldn't have
										gotten&nbsp;anything done&nbsp;tonight!
									</p>
									<p>
										Here's a basic summary of how things went tonight. Henry and
										Ronnie showed up first and got to work on finishing the
										wiring in the engine bay. They by far did the most, if not
										all of the work on the wiring on the car, I had put together
										three wires, but they as a team crank though some things,
										far faster that I could ever hope to.
									</p>
									<p>
										While they spent time working on the wiring in the engine
										bay I did a little work in the passenger compartment trying
										to get some wires run, finding parts for them, and trying to
										close up some ports on the intake before the turbo but after
										the MAF.
									</p>
									<p>
										Before heading to the interior to do wiring Henry, Ronnie
										and I attempted to crank the starter, to see if it would
										fire. Because this car is now a manual, but originally was
										an auto Ronnie wired up a relay to bypass the neutral safety
										switch that keeps the starter from firing if the car isn't
										in park. We were unable to locate the stock relay but found
										some of the wiring so we just ended up bypassing the whole
										thing.
									</p>
									<p>
										When they were working on the interior wiring I finished up
										some of the engine mount bolts that needed tightening and
										started cleaning up the Ford plug wires that I had picked up
										from the junk yard a while back.
									</p>
									<p>
										The rest of the guys started showing up, when Whittle called
										me I told him we were about half an hour from trying to
										start the car, he's the megasquirt Guru so I asked him to
										come over and assist us with things while we tried. By the
										time he arrived we weren't quite ready, but we thought we
										were close.
									</p>
									<p>
										Once the Whittle's showed up we ran some fuel through the
										fuel system into a jug (rather than the fuel rail) to try
										and clean out the hoses and pump, to keep any buildup from
										getting into the rail and injectors. That testing went fine,
										but as soon as we hooked the fuel lines back up and sent
										some pressure through the system we found a few leaks. The
										fittings at the fuel filter in the engine bay had been put
										together without teflon, lesson learned, 10 minutes later it
										was all back together again and pressure testing started up.
										Then we found a bigger issue, but one that didn't dump near
										as much fuel out. We can't seem to get the injector for the
										number 1 cylinder sealed into the fuel rail, it looks like
										the 2 and 3 injectors are also leaking a bit. So, tomorrow,
										the fuel rail will come off and we'll try to make
										adjustments.
									</p>
									<p>
										On the electrical side of things: At first we couldn't get
										the MS to fire up at all with the power from the car. After
										about 15 minutes, and Whittle about to give up I started
										looking for wires and remembered, we ran the TPS and TPS
										Signal wires, but don't currently have a TPS to hook up to,
										well sure enough, they were sitting right on the intake
										manifold. As soon as I removed them the Squirt fired up in
										Megatune. Then there were a few other gremlins. The MS
										seemed to be getting power spikes, though not completely
										resetting itself and firing the fuel pump again.
									</p>
									<p>
										At first we thought this was a grounding issue, but I
										believe I've now tracked it down just to be a source issue.
										While trying to track that down we started blowing fuses in
										the stock wiring. We couldn't figure out what that was
										happening until I looked at what we had wired into for the
										switched power line. I found that we were jumped into a line
										for the AC, well two days ago I pulled the AC system from
										under the dash and the wiring was still there, half hanging
										out of the car, which of course was touching the chassis,
										and causing out problem. Once I figured that out I removed
										the AC wire from the equation. That corrected the fuse
										issue, but we're still getting the power fluctuations, so
										I'll be tracking those down by checking grounds tomorrow,
										and then by running a new switched line from the battery if
										the ground search doesn't prove fruitful.
									</p>
									<p>
										As Terec and I were putting things away in the garage and
										rolling the car back in I noticed some antifreeze that was
										pooled up on the steering rack bracket. At first I thought
										this was related to a loose plug that Terec had found
										earlier in the night, so we soaked up the pool and hoped
										that would be all we had to think of that. I got under the
										car though and started looking around with a paper towel, I
										swear I though I found a place where more coolant was
										collecting, which isn't a good sign. So we gave it all a
										good wiping down to try and dry it off, I'll look at it
										again tomorrow and see if there's more coolant, and if so
										try to track down that leak.
									</p>
									<p>
										So as of right now, in order to get this car running I need
										to:
									</p>
									<p>a) figure out the wiring issue</p>
									<p>b) figure out the fuel leak in the rail</p>
									<p>
										c) see if the coolant is still leaking and then fix the
										leak.
									</p>
									<p>
										Of those items right now, C scares me the most, I'm hoping I
										don't have to replace a head gasket or anything of the like.
									</p>
									<p>
										I'll have video up from tonight, both my usual format, and
										some HD video as well.
