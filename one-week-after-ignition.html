			content='So it&#39;s been over a week now since I drove the 240Z for the first time. What have I gotten done in that timeframe? Not much! I basically didn&#39;t touch the car until Thursday, and all I did then was take a few minutes to inaccurately measure the requirements for the flange on the downpipe. Friday I picked up a header collector flange from my buddy Russ&#39; place. Sunday morning I went to work on that flange, it needed some help to make it fit. Sunday afternoon I spent some time in the sauna, I mean garage. I managed to get the coil pack and EDIS module mounted to the fender. I then started trying to clean up some of the wiring in the engine bay. I got some plastic loom a while back so I started running that to cover up the mess of wiring in the engine bay. I also ran the loom in the passenger compartment around some of the wiring in there. It&#39;s not finished, but it&#39;s definitely starting to look better. Dad helped me to put a switch inline for the main relay. Luckily with the car not idling yet I haven&#39;t had problems turning the car off, but with the way things were wired if the car was idling properly you&#39;d have to pull a fuse or disconnect the battery to shut off the car. Now that I have a switch it&#39;s easy to do! After that Dad and I put the hood and hinges on the car, the first time since I&#39;ve owned the 240 that it has had a hood attached! From there we loaded the car up onto the trailer later in the evening. This morning I got up early (a rarity for me) and took the car/trailer over to the Carx on St. Charles Rock Road in Bridgeton. Rick was extremely helpful over there and by 12pm today I was back up there loading the car up on the trailer with Eric&#39;s help. Carx put a 3" pipe from the downpipe back to the rear axle, with a turndown on the end. It&#39;s still quite loud, but if I do say so myself, it sounds pretty damn sweet! Eric and I brought the car home, and before trying to push it off the trailer I finally got it started. I&#39;m having starter issues and will probably try to replace the starter Thursday or Friday of this week. I drove the car off the trailer and into the garage, it&#39;s a beautiful sound! I&#39;m still aiming to compete drive&nbsp;the car at the Autocross on Sunday. Before I can do that I have quite a bit left to do. 1. Fix the idle (longer idle screw) 2. See if there&#39;s any fluid in the transmission (can&#39;t get the fill plug out so I&#39;ve not pulled the drain plug yet) 3. Build a bulkhead/firewall for the fuel cell 4. Finish up wiring for the O2 sensor 5. Get a harness squared away 6. More stuff I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve forgotten!'

										So it's been over a week now since I drove the 240Z for the
										first time. What have I gotten done in that timeframe? Not
										much!
									</p>
									<p>
										I basically didn't touch the car until Thursday, and all I
										did then was take a few minutes to inaccurately measure the
										requirements for the flange on the downpipe. Friday I picked
										up a header collector flange from my buddy Russ' place.
										Sunday morning I went to work on that flange, it needed some
										help to make it fit.
									</p>
									<p>
										Sunday afternoon I spent some time in the sauna, I mean
										garage. I managed to get the coil pack and EDIS module
										mounted to the fender. I then started trying to clean up
										some of the wiring in the engine bay. I got some plastic
										loom a while back so I started running that to cover up the
										mess of wiring in the engine bay. I also ran the loom in the
										passenger compartment around some of the wiring in there.
										It's not finished, but it's definitely starting to look
										better.
									</p>
									<p>
										Dad helped me to put a switch inline for the main relay.
										Luckily with the car not idling yet I haven't had problems
										turning the car off, but with the way things were wired if
										the car was idling properly you'd have to pull a fuse or
										disconnect the battery to shut off the car. Now that I have
										a switch it's easy to do!
									</p>
									<p>
										After that Dad and I put the hood and hinges on the car, the
										first time since I've owned the 240 that it has had a hood
										attached! From there we loaded the car up onto the trailer
										later in the evening.
									</p>
									<p>
										This morning I got up early (a rarity for me) and took the
										car/trailer over to the Carx on St. Charles Rock Road in
										Bridgeton. Rick was extremely helpful over there and by 12pm
										today I was back up there loading the car up on the trailer
										with Eric's help. Carx put a 3&quot; pipe from the downpipe
										back to the rear axle, with a turndown on the end.
									</p>
									<p>
										It's still quite loud, but if I do say so myself, it sounds
										pretty damn sweet! Eric and I brought the car home, and
										before trying to push it off the trailer I finally got it
										started. I'm having starter issues and will probably try to
										replace the starter Thursday or Friday of this week.
									</p>
									<p>
										I drove the car off the trailer and into the garage, it's a
										beautiful sound!
									</p>
									<p>
										I'm still aiming to <s>compete</s> drive&nbsp;the car at the
										Autocross on Sunday. Before I can do that I have quite a bit
										left to do.
									</p>
									<p>
										1. Fix the idle (longer idle screw)<br />
										2. See if there's any fluid in the transmission (can't get
										the fill plug out so I've not pulled the drain plug yet)<br />
										3. Build a bulkhead/firewall for the fuel cell<br />
										4. Finish up wiring for the O2 sensor<br />
										5. Get a harness squared away<br />
										6. More stuff I'm sure I've forgotten!
