<P>Today I spent some time trying to get the parts car all finished up. I removed a lot of the rear interior with hopes that some of it will work out in the 240z, we'll see if it will or not tomorrow.</p>
<p>I also completely removed the dash, pedal assembly, the master cylinders for the clutch and brakes. I also removed the hatch lock, and driver's door lock with hopes that I can reuse those in the 240 since I have&nbsp;a set of keys for the 280. Tomorrow I have to pull the diff out of the rear, and remove the passenger door lock, then it'll be time to load it up on the trailer and haul it off to the scrap yard. </p>
<p>No video today, I wanted to just get some work done without going through the hassle of setting up the camera. Perhaps I'll use it tomorrow when I finish up.</P>
