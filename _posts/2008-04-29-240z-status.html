<p>Alright, here's my goal, and I'm stating it here so I can hopefully hold myself accountable.</p>
<p>I want to bring the Datsun home from storage in May. In order to do that I need to make room in the garage, which means finding a place for the following</p>
<p>16 tires/wheels (headed to the basement)</p>
<p>Complete Datsun Suspension (disassemble and then take to basement)</p>
<p>Dispose of an automatic transmission for the Datsun</p>
<p>Dispose of a 5 Speed for the Datsun (someone is supposed to be picking it up tonight)</p>
<p>After making room I need to finish putting the motor together, which I should be able to do in a couple hours worth of work this week and coming weekend.</p>
<p>I'll post later this week with how I'm progressing.</p>
