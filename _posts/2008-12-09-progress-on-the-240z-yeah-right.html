<p>Not much progress has been made on the car lately. Since I lasted work on the car I've been pretty much working on work and school stuff non stop, no car work.&#160;I was in Vegas at a conference for a week, I started working on my book (work related) and then I've been finishing up a econ paper that I was supposed to do this past summer, and am just now getting finished up.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>I'm off to California next week, so it's not looking like I'll get anything done on the car until the week of Christmas, hopefully with my dad here in town that week he can get me motivated, perhaps we can even get the motor in the car! lofty goals :)</p>

<p>I did order some Bushings last week off of Ebay when they were having the 30% cashback special from live.com</p>

<p>Hopefully I'll have more updates in two weeks if we get started while&#160;my parents&#160;are in town for the holidays.</p>
