<p>I just got off the phone with <a href="http://www.lonewolfperformance.com">www.lonewolfperformance.com</a> and ordered my fuel rail for the Project 240Z. Hopefully it will be here next week. Tomorrow I'll get on ordering the other parts I need, a guage, regulator and some fittings. As well as starting to locate some injectors!</p>
<p>Thanks for James at Lonewolf for all the help on the phone today, he was great with answering my questions, and guess where they're from? Salina Kansas of all places, I guess I'll have to get the car ready and make it to an event in Salina sometime next year!</p>
