<p>Today, while I was hard at work, a buddy of mine sent me a link to a car on Ebay, it was a <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/1984-GTI-RABBIT-517-ORIGINAL-MILES-ORIGINAL-OWNER_W0QQitemZ130335847774QQcmdZViewItemQQptZUS_Cars_Trucks?hash=item1e589f355e#ht_500wt_1182">1984 Rabbit GTI with 517 original mile</a>s. I was looking at the car in amazement, seeing it was in St. Louis, and more so in Creve Couer, near where we used to live.</p>  

<p>From there I clicked on another link, I'm not even sure which one, and I came across a list of cars, one that peaked my interest, a <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/Electric-Car-1957-Porsche-356-Speedster-Replica_W0QQitemZ260484651636QQcmdZViewItemQQptZUS_Cars_Trucks?hash=item3ca6185a74">356 speedster replica</a>. I decided to check it out, and then I started reading more realizing it was also local to St. Louis, but get this. It is electric!&#160;I thought, oh that's cool, but then I scrolled down and started watching the video embedded into the ebay page. I'm 68 minutes into it, it's a 91 minute video.</p> 

<p>This is awesome, I so want to turn the 240Z into an electric car now! I know a guy who works for <a href="http://www.a123systems.com/">A123Systems</a>, I wonder if I couldn't get a good deal on some batteries? :)&#160;</p>
<p>If you've got some time to kill, check out the video! You can also watch more of his videos at <a href="http://evtv.me">http://evtv.me</a>&#160;it looks like I've got videos to watch for a week now! Maybe I can download them and watch them on the plasma.&#160;</p>
