<P>Mark from The Rally Bug (<A href="http://www.321govideo.com/rallybug"><U><FONT color=#0000ff>http://www.321govideo.com/rallybug</FONT></U></A>) stopped by tonight and dropped off his welder for me to borrow for a week. He was also kind enough to give me some brief lessons as it's been a while (proly 10 years) since I've welded anything!</p>
<p>Thanks Mark for your help tonight, now I can get going on some Major items for the 240z!</p>
