<p>Two years ago today was the day that the Datsun toasted Motor #1 on it's first autocross run! Here’s a shot of that first competition run.</p>

<p>And then a short time later (same run) here’s my getting out to push it</p>

<p>Here’s what we found when we just happened to pull plug #2</p>

<p>And then this is what it looked like when I went to drain the oil from the motor</p>

<p>A few things have happened in the two years since that fateful day. A few months later I purchased a <a href="http://www.corvettez06.org" target="_blank">2004 Corvette Z06</a> and autocrossed that for a year.</p>
<p>I sold the Corvette.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.project240z.com/Blog/itemId/430/Packing-the-garage-driving-the-car.aspx" target="_blank">I got the Datsun running again with another motor</a>, same turbo setup. </p>
<p>We moved to Colorado. <a href="http://www.going2colorado.com">www.going2colorado.com</a></p>
<p>In the next few weeks I hope to get more of the 240 back together, starting to work on the electrical system and such. Then during the first week of September the car goes to <a href="http://www.hanksvillehotrods.com">www.hanksvillehotrods.com</a> for a new exhaust, maybe I can talk them into a cage too ;)</p>
