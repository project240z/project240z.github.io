<p>Well, I will be the first to admit. I'm a total NOOB when it comes to Turbos, heck engines for that matter. Tonight I ran across the link below over on <a href="http://www.hybridz.org">Hybridz</a> and have spent a little time reading it. I've learned a bit so far, though I've barely cracked the surface!</p>
