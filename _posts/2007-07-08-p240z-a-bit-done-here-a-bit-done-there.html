<p>Take 2, stupid internet browsers, I typed this once, I guess that's what I get for not typing it up in Windows Live Writer instead of in the browser.</p>
<p>As anyone who has read the blog consistantly will know, I never get as much done as I &quot;plan&quot; to do in a given time frame, this weekend so far is no exception.</p>
<p>Thursday I got most of the driver's seat mounts welded into place, but I didn't finish them off, I left the tabs for the actualy mounts off.</p>
<p>Friday night I tested some rust remover on the exhaust manifold, no luck on removing any rust with the products I tried.</p>
<p>This morning I got up at 9:30am, lounged around for an hour and a half. I went out to the garage and welded in the tabs for the driver's side seat mount. From there I was all over the place, here's a list of things I worked on today, in no particular order</p>  <ul>      <li>Test fitted new injectors in fuel rail/intake manifold</li>      <li>Cleaned the intake manifold</li>      <li>Cleaned the exhaust manifold</li>      <li>Test fitted IAT sensor in intake manifold</li>      <li>Cleaned the transmission and bell housing</li>      <li>Scraped undercoating off the car around the transmission tunnel and floorboards</li>      <li>Removed all the stock fuel lines (3)</li>      <li>Mounted the fuel pump and bracket</li>      <li>Test ran some new braided fuel line (need to buy more as I don't think 20ft is enough</li>      <li>Prepped the driver's side interior for paint (removed paint/primer, will do passenger side and paint later this week)</li>  </ul>  <p>I've gotta try to hit the junk yard tomorrow, also will be racing Jansoon's M3, so we'll see how my first BMW experience goes.</p>
<p>Here are photos of the driver's side seat mounts, as well as the prep work for paint.</p>
