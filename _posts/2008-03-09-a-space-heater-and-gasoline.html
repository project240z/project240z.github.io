<p>Today Nick and I ran around town, getting some metal for his 240Z, then around to find a few other supplies that he needed.</p>
<p>When I got home I was half motivated to work on the car! So I went out to the garage, after sitting on the couch for 30 minutes, and got to working. It's still cold here in St. Louis so I had the garage door closed and decided to plug the space heater in to warm it up a little bit.</p>
<p>I put together&#160;a little rolling stool that I purchased from Sears a few weeks back (please don't visit <a href="http://www.slickdeals.net">www.slickdeals.net</a>, that site will make you spend more money at Sears than you ever have before). After putting the stool together I decided I should get to work on the motor.</p>
<p>What motor? This motor is out of a 78 280Z 2+2. The parts car, it ran when I got it, so the plan right now is to transfer the turbo/intake/fuel system from the blown 83 motor to this motor.</p>
<p>So I started on the motor, working on taking the fuel rail off the motor, along with the injectors and such (all this will be for sale later this week).&#160;I had most everything removed so that I could pull the fuel rail and injectors when I found one hose that was still hooked up to the intake manifold. Being that the motor is 30 years old some of the hoses and clamps are a little hard to remove, easy enough fix, I got a pair of dykes and started cutting.</p>
<p>Out pours some gasoline, which I found odd that there was still any fuel in the system. A few moments later when more fuel poured out I realized that the space heater was sitting less than 2 feet from where the fuel was hitting the floor.</p>
<p>Talk about getting your heart rate going, I jumped, grabbed the space heater and lifted it off the ground, quickly unplugging it and removing it from the area.</p>
<p>Thankfully nothing caught fire! That would of sucked! More work tomorrow, I'm going to try and get the motor up on an engine stand so I can replace the rear main seal which leaks, and try to check everything over before I put it all back together.</p>
<p>I could "possibly" have this motor running by the end of the month in the car. But I know how lazy and busy I am, so I have no doubts that there is no way I'll get all that done :) More info and pictures tomorrow, possibly even a new 240Z video!</p>
