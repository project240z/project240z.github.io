<p>Well, Wednesday night was an eventful night. When I got home from work I  jumped under the car and tried to track down my coolant leak. I found small  traces of coolant here and there, but I didn't find any big problems. While  under the car I found a few other things. I noticed that the oil return line off  the bottom of the turbo wasn't hooked up. Thankfully I found that, had I tried  to start the car with that disconnected we would of had a real mess on our  hands.</p>
<p>I found the coolant leak I was looking for, it, like the first coolant leak  we found on Tuesday night, was in the thermostat housing. There was a plug in  the housing that hadn't been covered in teflon and hadn't been tightened down  enough either. After that I started to hookup the vacuum lines for the wastegate  to the turbo.</p>
<p>Once I had finished under the car I decided it was time to track down the  fuel leak in the rail. We initially though that the first 3 injectors were  leaking on the rail, so I spent an hour notching the fuel rail brackets so that  I could lower the rail close to the intake manifold more, adjusting the angle of  the injectors. This ended up not being the cause of the leak, but I do believe  that the angle of the injectors is now much better than before as they sit in  the rail and intake much better now.</p>
<p>The cause of the fuel leak ended up being the 45 degree fitting we had on the  inlet end of the rail. When removing the fitting on the rail I found that both  the threads on the fitting and the rail were bunged up really good. There was no  reusing the fitting so I would have to get another one and retap the rail.</p>
