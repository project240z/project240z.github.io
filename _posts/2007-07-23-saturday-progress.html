<p>Eric and I got a bit done today. Mostly learning with the help of Andy Whittle who stopped by to assist with some Megasquirt questions. I also did some soldering on the Megasquirt wiring, LOTS more soldering to do tomorrow!</p>
<p>The fuel cell is mounted, Eric started on the oil cooler mounting, we ended up figuring out that I did have the correct peices for that, so all that money isn't wasted.</p>
<p>Sunday tasks</p>
<p>Connect Fuel Lines<br />  Run Megasquirt Wires, Fuses, Relays<br />  Install Megasquirt<br />  Install Fuse Panel<br />  Install Battery (charge battery)<br />  Install Seats<br />  Install Radiator<br />  Connect Starter<br />  Connect Alternator<br />  Add Oil to the Motor and Transmission<br />  Add Coolant<br />  I'm sure I'll have to add more to this list.</p>
