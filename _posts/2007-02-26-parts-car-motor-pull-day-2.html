<p>Thanks to Terec for coming over today and helping me get the motor pulled out of the 78 280Z 2+2 parts car today!</p>

<p>Here's what we got done.</p>  <ul>      <li>Pulled the motor and transmission</li>      
    <li>Disconnected the driveshaft</li>      <li>Ruined a clutch line (that was all me)</li>  </ul>
