<p>Well today a key component of my project arrived, the downpipe for the Turbo showed up. At first I flipped out thinking it was the wrong downpipe.</p>

<p>Then someone on Hybrid Z kindly pointed out that I need to remove the stock wastegate housing in order&nbsp; to install this downpipe, which I believe is off a Z31 motor, instead of an L28ET motor like I have.</p>
<p>I'll be testing this out tomorrow, then I hope to try to get it over to Hackman to get it powder coated!</p>
