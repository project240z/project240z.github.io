<p>Tonight I told myself I wouldn't start the car, I would get ready for my trip to Chicago tomorrow (going up there to give two days of DotNetNuke training classes).</p>
<p>But I couldn't help myself, I had to get the camera and record the new exhaust! It's not quiet, but oh it sounds so sweet!</p>
