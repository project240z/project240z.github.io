<P>I spent a few hours on Sunday the 18th of March cleaning up the engine bay of&nbsp;my 1973 240Z.</p>
<p>Next week I hope to paint the engine bay and begin the process of putting the Turbo motor back in the car.  </p><P>&nbsp;</P>  <object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/ANz9qkmFiy0"/><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/ANz9qkmFiy0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="350"/></object>
