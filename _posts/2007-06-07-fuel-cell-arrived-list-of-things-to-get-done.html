<p>Alright, so my fuel cell arrived today! It sure is purty, and big</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/533611292/"><img height="180" alt="" width="240" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1378/533611292_1ac9563345_m.jpg" /></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not yet sure how I'm going to mount it in the car, though I'm hoping to talk to&nbsp;Mark Huebbe and borrow the welder again sometime soon so I can possibly make a bracket to mount it above the spare tire well in the car. That or perhaps I cut the well out and mount it, but that might be a future project.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.v8efi.com">Whittle</a> came over last night and we spent 3 hours going over the car and teaching me about relays and stuff about the Megasquirt. The squirt is nearly ready to install, he's adding a jumper to the board for the MAF, but other than that I think it's ready to go into the car as soon as I have all the wires run. I ran out tonight and picked up fuses, have yet to find a good fuse block though.</p>
<p>I tried Autozone, they had something that might work but I had hoped to find something a little cleaner so I ran to Radio Shack and Walmart, neither place had any fuse blocks to use. I'll try a few more places tomorrow and see what I can locate. I really only need like 6 fuses but I bought plenty of spares. I need to fabricate something to mount the fuse block and a couple of relays too. I'm thinking some sort of black plexiglass/lexan or acryllic of some sort, though I'm not sure where to even begin looking for something like that in town, so they might just get bolted down to a piece of sheet metal for the time being.</p>
<p>So what's next? Here are my goals for this weekend.</p>  <ol>      <li>Get the fuel cell mounted and lines ran, I ordered a fuel pump from Jegs yesterday, should be tomorrow or Friday.</li>      <li>Remove the oil cooler attachments for now and screw on the filter in place of the adapter, I'll run without one for a bit, once I plan on having the car driving for more than 15-30 minutes at a time (1-3 minutes for autocross) I'll look at oil cooler options</li>      <li>Mount the VR sensor for the Megasquirt</li>      <li>Mount the radiator and get hoses that will work.</li>      <li>Get the other set of front rotors turned and put back on the car w/ new bearings.</li>  </ol>  <p>Pictures and video of this weekends work coming early next week!</p>
<p>As for what's after this weekend? Well getting all the wires for the Megasquirt run! Hopefully Nick can assist me with that next week over a few nights and we'll see if I can't get this darn car ready to run!</p>
<p>Update: I found a source for Plexiglass and ordered a few square feet, some black and some smoked!</p>
