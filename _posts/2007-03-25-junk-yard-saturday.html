<P>Today, well yesterday now, it's 1am, Dad and I went to Speedway salvage over in Madison Illinois. 3-4 hours later we walked out of there with $120 worth of parts for the Project 240Z. I didn't realize you could spend that much on junk?</p>
<p>I got most of the ignition system I needed to complete the Megasquirt setup, some interior plastics I needed, as well as&nbsp;the steering wheel off my parts car that I dropped off at Speedway two weeks ago. I think they even charged me for the wheel.</p>
<p>Dad took apart the brake master cylinder and start cleaning it, we'll do the same with the clutch cylinder tomorrow, and reassemble that with the rebuild kit I picked up this evening. I couldn't find a brake mc kit in town tonight, so that will have to be a future product. I also picked up 7 feet of hydrolic line to run a new clutch line and repair a brake line I had to cut last week.</p>
<p>Tomorrow (Today)&nbsp;we'll see how far we can get towards putting the 83 motor into the car. I'm going to be working on getting the parts we need off&nbsp;of the motor from the parts car so we can&nbsp;get the motor setup to drop in the car.</p>
<p>More tomorrow&nbsp;</P>
