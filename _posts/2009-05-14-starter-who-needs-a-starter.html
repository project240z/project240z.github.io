<p>Well it did run for about 10 seconds on Saturday, then I redid the wire for the VR sensor and created some problems. So I redid the wiring tonight, and went to start it.   <br />Then the starter did this....    <br /><img border="0" alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2196/3529003195_f86d5d45e1.jpg?v=0" />    <br /></p>
<p>It quit engaging so I pulled it out and it fell apart as I was lifting it out of the car. Fortunately this cheap POS is under a lifetime warranty from Autozone, so they are ordering the part in, Iâ€™ll pick it up when I get back home from the lake trip this weekend. Hopefully I will attempt to start the car again on Sunday.</p>
