<p>I sanded the area that I bondo'd yesterday on the 240Z. I also then cleaned and sprayed it with primer. Now the Project 240Z officially consists of 6, count them 6, colors. Blue, orange, white, black, brown, and grey. After that I removed the gas tank so I can have that cleaned up like we had done with the radiator last week.    </p>    <object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/7nKCMSlfkio"/><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/7nKCMSlfkio" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="350"/></object>
