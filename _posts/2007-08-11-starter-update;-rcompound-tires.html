<p>I pulled the starter out of the car last night and will be putting a new one back in the car tonight. Dad and I will also be working on the idle screw to see if we can't get the car to idle properly.</p>
<p>Over lunch I ran to <a href="http://www.soloperformance.com/">SPS</a> and mounted RComps to the stock wheels, thanks to Uncle Bud for the tires! I also picked up a cool 3&quot; GForce harness to try and mount in the car to keep me planted!</p>
<p>Tomorrow Dad and I will be heading to Sam Platt's to get some assistance in building the bulkhead to section off the fuel cell from the passenger compartment.</p>
<p>There's still a lot of work to do before the race on Sunday, but I think with Dad's help I'll be able to get it all done!</p>
