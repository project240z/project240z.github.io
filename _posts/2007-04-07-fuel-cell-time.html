<P>I took the gas tank out of the 240Z down to Manchester Radiator on Wednesday. They called me on Thursday to tell me that the tank was in a sad state. They dipped it and cleaned it up to find a lot of pinholes and larger holes in the bottom of the tank from rust. Rather than repair it they asked me if I could get another one from somewhere.</p>
<p>Lucky for me SM2 allows for Fuel Cells, now I just need to read up on the rules and figure out where I can mount one legally in my car, and figure out how much that is going to end up costing me.</p>
<p>The car hasn't been touched since last Sunday, and won't see any action before at least Thursday as Natalie and I are headed to Boston tomorrow for Opening Day on Tuesday.</P>
