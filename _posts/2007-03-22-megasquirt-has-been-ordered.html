<P>Even though I'm out in Mormanville I've been&nbsp;hard at work at least thinking about the Project 240z!&nbsp;&nbsp;With the guidance of Mr. Whittle I've ordered over $700 in equipment to get the motor wired up with Megasquirt.</p>
<p>I hope to hit the junk yard on Friday and find a few more random Ford Ignition parts that I need for the megasquirt setup, and hopefully the megasquirt parts from DiyAutotune will be here early next week. My dad will be in town this coming weekend, so I plan to put him to work the next few weeks to help me get this car ready for April 15th.</P>
