<p>So this coming weekend will be the first free weekend I've had since the first weekend in September, and that was pretty much a weekend spent getting ready for the Solo Nationals. I&#160;hadn't had a free weekend before that since Mid June, needless to say the Datsun hasn't seen much love in a while. Well this weekend that changes. I'm going to try to get the motor back together, and see how far I can't get to putting it back in the car!</p>
