<p>Apparently that’s the word on the 240z. I sold it in January 2010 (or somewhere close to there) and since then it has apparently changed owners twice (possibly more).</p>  <p>I emailed <a href="http://www.project240z.com/Blog/itemId/479/The-240z-Lives-and-it-looks-great.aspx" target="_blank">the guy who sent me photos in October after he painted it</a>, to see how it was, and he tells me it was sold in December <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-sadsmile" alt="Sad smile" src="http://www.project240z.com/Portals/0/PublishThumbnails/Windows-Live-Writer/This-240z-gets-around_C988/wlEmoticon-sadsmile_2.png" /></p>  <p>If you are the new owner, drop me a line, I’m curious how things are going.</p>
