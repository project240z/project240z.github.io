<p>Apparently that’s the word on the 240z. I sold it in January 2010 (or somewhere close to there) and since then it has apparently changed owners twice (possibly more).</p>
<p>I emailed <a href="/the-240z-lives-and-it-looks-great">the guy who sent me photos in October after he painted it</a>, to see how it was, and he tells me it was sold in December 
    </p>
<p>If you are the new owner, drop me a line, I’m curious how things are going.</p>
