<p>I emailed the Z Store on Tuesday, and haven't heard back from them. I'm looking at their MSA Type III body kit for the Project 240z. Anyone ever dealt with them, or seen the body kit before?</p>
<p>The question I had for them was does the kit require a front bumper, or does it replace the bumper? Other questions I have for anyone who has seen the kit in person, what'd you think? Was the kit something worthwhile?</p>
