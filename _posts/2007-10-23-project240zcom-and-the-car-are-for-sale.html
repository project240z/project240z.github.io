<p>With my <a href="http://www.corvettez06.org">recent acquisition</a> I'm going to have to clear out the garage of all of my Datsun parts and cars to make room for a few other vehicles.</p>
<p>I'm going to start putting together information on what all I have for sale, but here's a rough idea.</p>
<p><strong>1973 Datsun 240Z </strong>(sans motor)<br />  Megasquirt Ford EDIS ignition<br />  Brand New Corbeau A4 seats<br />  <br />  <strong>1978 280Z 2+2 Motor L28E</strong><br />  Ran when removed from parts car, currently needs some parts from the L28ET installed to use the Megasquirt, needs rear main seal replaced.</p>
<p><strong>(2) 1979 Datsun 5 Speeds</strong>, one needs rebuilt<br />  1973 Datsun 240Z Automatic Transmission<br />  <br />  <strong>1983 280ZX L28ET </strong>(#2 piston blew up, head can be repaired and turbo system should be usable) Downpipe and custom exhaust&nbsp;</p>
<p>Complete second sport suspension for the car, ready to be cleaned up to be powder coated and installed.<br />  <br />  <strong>New Fuel System</strong><br />  15 Gallon fuel cell<br />  High Pressure Fuel Pump<br />  AN hose and fittings front to back<br />  Custom fuel rail<br />  Ford Lightning Injectors</p>
<p><strong>Website<br />  </strong>Project240Z.com&nbsp;domain name, and 1 year of website hosting, training of use of website. The site gets a lot of traffic from search engine results.<br />  DVD of the original video files of all the video recordings I have that I used in Project240z.com videos</p>
<p>I'm not sure what all I want to ask for this, it could be a very fun project, with the most expensive parts already purchased and installed.</p>
<p>If you're interested start making me an offer, if I consider it reasonable I'll respond.</p>
<p>Currently not looking to part things out, yet.</p>
