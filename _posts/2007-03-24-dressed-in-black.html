<P>Well the engine bay of the Project 240Z has a nice coat of black paint. I'll be touching up a few areas tomorrow, as well as doing the following.</p>
<p>Hitting the Junkyard to locate parts I still need for the megasquirt setup, including mostly these ford parts: throttlebody from a V8, VR Sensor from a V6, fuel injectors, wires, coils. </p>
<p>I'll also be hitting the parts store for some new break and clutch lines, installing the clutch line, and hopefully starting to put the transmission&nbsp;onto the turbo motor.</p>
<p>Photos tomorrow.</P>
