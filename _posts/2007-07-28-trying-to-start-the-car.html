<p>Here's some video of me trying to start the car tonight. <span id="vidDescRemain" style="display: inline">Today was a day of great progress! It was also hot and probably 99% humidity as you will see by my soaked shirt. <br />  <br />  Notice at the end that one of the vacuum caps on the tube between the turbo and the throttle body pops off, it landed in my lap.</span></p>
