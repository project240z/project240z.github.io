<p>I got some work done on the car, I think I figured out one of the biggest holdups I've had.</p>
<p>The JPipe on my motor (the pipe from the Turbo to the Throttlebody) was mangled pretty bad, so much it wouldn't get a good seal on the throttlebody. Last night I cut about 4 inches out of it and bashed it with a rubber mallet for a while. I think I managed to get it where it will get a seat on the throttle body and still connect to the turbo. At least, hopefully a good enough seal the motor will run, after it runs the pipe will be tossed as it'll get replaced with an intercooler.</p>
<p>After playing with the pipe for a while I finally got around to removing the wastegate cover, tonight I'll test fit the downpipe onto the turbo. Here are some photos from last night.</p>
