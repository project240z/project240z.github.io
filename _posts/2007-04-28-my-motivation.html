<P>I was digging through some old photos tonight looking for photos of <A href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/475212637/">Jeff Krekeler</A>, when I ran across this photo I took back in June of 2004. </p>
<p><A href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/475215675/"><IMG height=159 alt="" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/220/475215675_9714ae505d_m.jpg" width=240></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I get bored, lazy, or tired of working on the Project240z, I only have to look at that photo and realize what I'm striving for. That car is beautiful, and&nbsp;I hope my car can one day look that good...</P>
