<p>Fuel leaks, coolant leaks and blown fuses. That about sums up the  evening...</p>
<p>First off, a HUGE thanks to everyone who came over tonight. Henry,  Ronnie,&nbsp;Terec, Ian, Eric, Scott and Andy, without you guys helping out I  wouldn't have gotten&nbsp;anything done&nbsp;tonight!</p>
<p>Here's a basic summary of how things went tonight. Henry and Ronnie showed up  first and got to work on finishing the wiring in the engine bay. They by far did  the most, if not all of the work on the wiring on the car, I had put together  three wires, but they as a team crank though some things, far faster that I  could ever hope to.</p>
<p>While they spent time working on the wiring in the engine bay I did a little  work in the passenger compartment trying to get some wires run, finding parts  for them, and trying to close up some ports on the intake before the turbo but  after the MAF.</p>
<p>Before heading to the interior to do wiring Henry, Ronnie and I attempted to  crank the starter, to see if it would fire. Because this car is now a manual,  but originally was an auto Ronnie wired up a relay to bypass the neutral safety  switch that keeps the starter from firing if the car isn't in park. We were  unable to locate the stock relay but found some of the wiring so we just ended  up bypassing the whole thing.</p>
<p>When they were working on the interior wiring I finished up some of the  engine mount bolts that needed tightening and started cleaning up the Ford plug  wires that I had picked up from the junk yard a while back.</p>
<p>The rest of the guys started showing up, when Whittle called me I told him we  were about half an hour from trying to start the car, he's the megasquirt Guru  so I asked him to come over and assist us with things while we tried. By the  time he arrived we weren't quite ready, but we thought we were close.</p>
<p>Once the Whittle's showed up we ran some fuel through the fuel system into a  jug (rather than the fuel rail) to try and clean out the hoses and pump, to keep  any buildup from getting into the rail and injectors. That testing went fine,  but as soon as we hooked the fuel lines back up and sent some pressure through  the system we found a few leaks. The fittings at the fuel filter in the engine  bay had been put together without teflon, lesson learned, 10 minutes later it  was all back together again and pressure testing started up. Then we found a  bigger issue, but one that didn't dump near as much fuel out. We can't seem to  get the injector for the number 1 cylinder sealed into the fuel rail, it looks  like the 2 and 3 injectors are also leaking a bit. So, tomorrow, the fuel rail  will come off and we'll try to make adjustments.</p>
<p>On the electrical side of things: At first we couldn't get the MS to fire up  at all with the power from the car. After about 15 minutes, and Whittle about to  give up I started looking for wires and remembered, we ran the TPS and TPS  Signal wires, but don't currently have a TPS to hook up to, well sure enough,  they were sitting right on the intake manifold. As soon as I removed them the  Squirt fired up in Megatune. Then there were a few other gremlins. The MS seemed  to be getting power spikes, though not completely resetting itself and firing  the fuel pump again.</p>
<p>At first we thought this was a grounding issue, but I believe I've now  tracked it down just to be a source issue. While trying to track that down we  started blowing fuses in the stock wiring. We couldn't figure out what that was  happening until I looked at what we had wired into for the switched power line.  I found that we were jumped into a line for the AC, well two days ago I pulled  the AC system from under the dash and the wiring was still there, half hanging  out of the car, which of course was touching the chassis, and causing out  problem. Once I figured that out I removed the AC wire from the equation. That  corrected the fuse issue, but we're still getting the power fluctuations, so  I'll be tracking those down by checking grounds tomorrow, and then by running a  new switched line from the battery if the ground search doesn't prove  fruitful.</p>
<p>As Terec and I were putting things away in the garage and rolling the car  back in I noticed some antifreeze that was pooled up on the steering rack  bracket. At first I thought this was related to a loose plug that Terec had  found earlier in the night, so we soaked up the pool and hoped that would be all  we had to think of that. I got under the car though and started looking around  with a paper towel, I swear I though I found a place where more coolant was  collecting, which isn't a good sign. So we gave it all a good wiping down to try  and dry it off, I'll look at it again tomorrow and see if there's more coolant,  and if so try to track down that leak.</p>
<p>So as of right now, in order to get this car running I need to:</p>
<p>a) figure out the wiring issue</p>
<p>b) figure out the fuel leak in the rail</p>
<p>c) see if the coolant is still leaking and then fix the leak.</p>
<p>Of those items right now, C scares me the most, I'm hoping I don't have to  replace a head gasket or anything of the like.</p>
<p>I'll have video up from tonight, both my usual format, and some HD video as well.</p>
