<p>While in Atlanta for the National Tour Carter Thompson brought me a gift. He had a lightened flywheel from his 240Z that he had been telling me about for the past two years. At the National Tour he brought me the flywheel. I must admit, at the time I carried it from his truck to the SPS Van I kept thinking, this sure doesn't feel light.</p>
<p>Tonight though I was moving things around in the garage and came across both the stock and lightened fly wheels, the new wheel is definitely lighter than the stock wheel!</p>
<p>Now, I just need to make some time to get the motor together so I can bring the car home sometime soon!</p>
