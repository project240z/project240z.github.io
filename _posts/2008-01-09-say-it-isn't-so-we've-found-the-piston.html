<p>What? Chris actually worked on the 240Z? Impossible! It tis true, it really is. Tonight&nbsp;I got home and decided it was time to tear into the motor, so I did just that. I even recorded the whole process, so hopefully I'll have video up soon. For now you can check out the photos of what I found, be warned, it's not pretty!</p>
<p>Here's the first one, this is NOT ALL of the parts, there are still parts in the motor that may never come out.</p>

<p>At first I thought I found a nut, and that was the culprit of the whole mess. I don't believe that to be the case, I believe the nuts/bolts connecting the rod to the crankshaft came free, though, perhaps that was the problem, maybe they were lose?</p>

<p>I'm going to save this piece, and perhaps attach it to my office door at work.</p>
