<p>So it's been over a week now since I drove the 240Z for the first time. What have I gotten done in that timeframe? Not much!</p>
<p>I basically didn't touch the car until Thursday, and all I did then was take a few minutes to inaccurately measure the requirements for the flange on the downpipe. Friday I picked up a header collector flange from my buddy Russ' place. Sunday morning I went to work on that flange, it needed some help to make it fit.</p>
<p>Sunday afternoon I spent some time in the sauna, I mean garage. I managed to get the coil pack and EDIS module mounted to the fender. I then started trying to clean up some of the wiring in the engine bay. I got some plastic loom a while back so I started running that to cover up the mess of wiring in the engine bay. I also ran the loom in the passenger compartment around some of the wiring in there. It's not finished, but it's definitely starting to look better.</p>
<p>Dad helped me to put a switch inline for the main relay. Luckily with the car not idling yet I haven't had problems turning the car off, but with the way things were wired if the car was idling properly you'd have to pull a fuse or disconnect the battery to shut off the car. Now that I have a switch it's easy to do!</p>
<p>After that Dad and I put the hood and hinges on the car, the first time since I've owned the 240 that it has had a hood attached! From there we loaded the car up onto the trailer later in the evening.</p>
<p>This morning I got up early (a rarity for me) and took the car/trailer over to the Carx on St. Charles Rock Road in Bridgeton. Rick was extremely helpful over there and by 12pm today I was back up there loading the car up on the trailer with Eric's help. Carx put a 3&quot; pipe from the downpipe back to the rear axle, with a turndown on the end.</p>
<p>It's still quite loud, but if I do say so myself, it sounds pretty damn sweet! Eric and I brought the car home, and before trying to push it off the trailer I finally got it started. I'm having starter issues and will probably try to replace the starter Thursday or Friday of this week.</p>
<p>I drove the car off the trailer and into the garage, it's a beautiful sound!</p>
<p>I'm still aiming to <s>compete</s> drive&nbsp;the car at the Autocross on Sunday. Before I can do that I have quite a bit left to do.</p>
<p>1. Fix the idle (longer idle screw)<br />  2. See if there's any fluid in the transmission (can't get the fill plug out so I've not pulled the drain plug yet)<br />  3. Build a bulkhead/firewall for the fuel cell<br />  4. Finish up wiring for the O2 sensor<br />  5. Get a harness squared away<br />  6. More stuff I'm sure I've forgotten!</p>
