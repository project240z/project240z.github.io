<p>It was time to get rid of all the parts I still have taking up space in the garage from the 350z! <a target="_blank" href="http://motors.search.ebay.com/_W0QQsassZchristoc">They're all on ebay</a>. </p>
<p>SA Koni Sports F/R (used) #150097486225<br />  350Evo Front Sway Bar (used) #150097461781<br />  CT-1 Front Sway Bar (new) #150097477452<br />  Hotchkis Rear Sway Bar (new) #150097479242</p>
<p>If anyone wants to buy them off ebay, let me know, I'll make a St. Louis deal for folks.</p>
